As legacies go it's a lot better than Brexit. The Prime Minister’s name was all over announcement of her government's “Online Harm” white paper, launched to coincide with yet another letter to the EU asking for an extension to Article 50 as Britain teeters on the cliff edge of a disaster of her own making. So were those of Digital Secretary Jeremy Wright and Home Secretary Sajid Javid, a contender to replace her. The white paper promising a new regulator to enforce strict new standards that tech companies like Facebook, Twitter will be told to abide by is officially a joint effort between their departments. You can understand why they all want a piece of this one. It is (for once) good politics. New Zealand’s privacy commissioner has just blasted Facebook as “morally bankrupt pathological liars” on his twitter feed over the hosting a livestream of the Christchurch mosque attack that left 50 people dead. Closer to home the suicide of teenager Molly Russell in 2017 remains in the spotlight thanks to the disturbing material found on her Instagram account and her parents’ understandable fury towards the tech company. They hold the Facebook subsidiary to be partially responsible for her death. Also prominent alongside the politicians in the launch announcement were Barnado’s, the NSPCC, Childnet, the Dianna Award and Internet Matters. That represents a powerful coalition in favour of ideas such as imposing a “duty of care” on internet businesses, together a demand that they shield people from potentially harmful content. Executives could be made personally liable in the event of breaches. They could lead to financial penalties. The latter makes sense when you consider the questionable impact that fines representing a tiny fraction of quarterly revenues have when levied on corporations alone. But it will go down like a wet weekend in Barrow in Furness with the Americans, who aren’t overly fond of people telling their top companies how they should be doing business. The proposed legislation will apply to any company that allows users to share or discover user generated content or interact with each other online. Most of them are based across the Atlantic. The other issue with what’s being proposed is how it squares with Britain’s stated aim of being the “best place in the world to start a new digital business”. I’m told any new regulator will be required to operate a “risk based approach”, offer support to start ups and pay due regard to innovation. Nonetheless, businesses tend to be wary of regulation, even when it may prove, in the long term, to be good for business. There are always other places you can go. However, other places may ultimately follow suit because the current situation is untenable. With new outrages seemingly emerging every week, even parts of the tech industry recognise that. And if the UK loses some business because of its stance on the online safety of children, that's frankly a price worth paying. The likes of Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg, among others, have called for a global approach, but that could easily be seen as an attempt to frustrate change. The weakness of the Paris Climate Accords, and the patchy observance of them in response to something that represents a clear and present danger to the future of life on this planet tells you all you need to know. What price digital regulation when compared to that. Others have already raised issues of free speech in response to what the government has served up. That merits careful monitoring given the antipathy of governments towards that.",may plays internet wyatt earp proposals crackdown online harm,theresa may online wyatt earp bringing order wild west big tech operating long legacies go lot better brexit prime minister name announcement online harm white paper launched coincide yet another letter eu asking extension article britain teeters cliff edge disaster making digital secretary jeremy wright home secretary sajid javid contender replace white paper promising new regulator enforce strict new standards tech companies like facebook twitter told abide officially joint effort departments understand want piece one good politics new zealand privacy commissioner blasted facebook morally bankrupt pathological liars twitter feed hosting livestream christchurch mosque attack left people dead closer home suicide teenager molly russell remains spotlight thanks disturbing material found instagram account parents understandable fury towards tech company hold facebook subsidiary partially responsible death also prominent alongside politicians launch announcement barnado nspcc childnet dianna award internet matters represents powerful coalition favour ideas imposing duty care internet businesses together demand shield people potentially harmful content executives could made personally liable event breaches could lead financial penalties latter makes sense consider questionable impact fines representing tiny fraction quarterly revenues levied corporations alone go like wet weekend barrow furness americans overly fond people telling top companies business proposed legislation apply company allows users share discover user generated content interact online based across atlantic issue proposed squares britain stated aim best place world start new digital business told new regulator required operate risk based approach offer support start ups pay due regard innovation nonetheless businesses tend wary regulation even may prove long term good business always places go however places may ultimately follow suit current situation untenable new outrages seemingly emerging every week even parts tech industry recognise uk loses business stance online safety children frankly price worth paying likes facebook boss mark zuckerberg among others called global approach could easily seen attempt frustrate change weakness paris climate accords patchy observance response something represents clear present danger future life planet tells need know price digital regulation compared others already raised issues free speech response government served merits careful monitoring given antipathy governments towards

As part of a code of conduct to be unveiled this week, people attempting to enter the market under the influence of drugs or alcohol will have their passes confiscated. The rationale is that a significant number of reported incidents of disgraceful behaviour towards female workers have been linked to drink. I’m told the market’s bosses were genuinely stung by them, and mean what they say about changing its culture. Obviously, actions speak louder than words. But they have secured the support of the institution’s various stakeholders for this and other measures designed to stamp out what has been going on. That should not be underestimated. As those with experience of covering it will be well aware, Lloyd’s is a very political place. It is the sum of many different parts, which frequently find themselves in conflict. Getting them all on the same page can sometimes feel like herding cats. Although being seen as a holdout on this issue would not be a good look for any of them, it’s one thing for institutions to sign up to the proposed changes, quite another for individuals to go along with them too. The market says it’s a case of time gentlemen please when comes to boozy lunches. And, given what’s been going on, about time too. But there will undoubtedly be those who hold out against what they perceive as the death of another hallowed part of the old City of London, and who feel the new rules don’t apply to them. Lloyd’s is not only a political place, it’s a conservative place (with a small c). Pity the security guards, who will be on the front line of this. They have an unenviable task.

The companies have formed an ""open pool"" that allows their fleets to be counted together under new rules that restrict emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), according to documents published by the European Union. The auto industry needs to slash CO2 emissions of vehicles sold in Europe by 25% to meet the aggressive caps by 2021, according to UBS. The Swiss bank's analysts estimate that will reduce EU carmaker profits by €7.4 billion ($8.3 billion) combined. Companies that are investing heavily in hybrid or electric vehicle technology, such as Volkswagen (VLKAF), are well positioned to meet the new standards. Laggards will need to find other ways of avoiding fines. UBS analysts warned last week that Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) was the automaker with the ""highest risk of not meeting the target."" ""Fiat Chrysler is facing the biggest challenges to comply with CO2 targets due to a period of under-investment in electrification,"" the UBS analysts wrote, adding that it's ""starting almost from scratch."" Joining forces with Tesla (TSLA) was one way for the company to reduce the risk of fines. Japanese automakers Toyota (TM) and Mazda (MZDAF) have also formed a pool. EU targets Fiat Chrysler said Monday that EU rules allowing carmakers to join forces to meet fleet CO2 targets provide ""flexibility to deliver products our customers are willing to buy while managing compliance."" ""The whole point of a CO2 credit market is to leverage the most cost-effective ways to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions in the market,"" the company said in a statement. The Financial Times, which was first to report the arrangement, said that Fiat Chrysler was paying Tesla (TSLA) hundreds of millions of euros for its emissions credits. Fiat Chrysler did not comment Monday on the financial details. It's not the first time that Tesla has received a financial windfall from its traditional competitors. The company brought in millions of dollars earlier this decade by selling credits tied to its electric cars in the United States, where carmakers were struggling to meet sales targets for zero-emissions vehicles. Tesla could use the cash infusion from Fiat Chrysler. It reported a sharp drop in deliveries during the first quarter, heightening concerns about its ability to pay down its sizable debts. In March, Tesla paid off a $920 million bond that took a big chunk out of the $3.7 billion in cash it had on hand at the start of the quarter. That followed a $230 million payment the company made in November. Its next big payment is a $566 million debt issue that is due in November, followed by another $1.4 billion in notes that is due in two years.

Space-mad Hayden Geraghty, nine, from Limavady, Northern Ireland, was non-verbal and only started saying full sentences around four years ago - and hasn't stopped since. Toy company Lottie Dolls was so impressed with his transformation it designed a toy inspired by Hayden. The first ever doll with autism, the figure wears blue astronaut overalls and ear defenders and sunglasses - to cope with light and sound sensitivity. Space-mad Hayden Geraghty, nine, from Limavady, Northern Ireland, holds the Finn Boy Doll by toy company Lottie Dolls, which is designed in his honour 'Mini Hayden' - officially called Finn Boy Doll - also has a service dog to help him cope with difficult situations, and communication cards to help him chat with his friends. The doll, which retails at £28.50, also wears a T-shirt which reads 'Tesla, Einstein & Me' - a nod to genius scientists Nikola Tesla and Albert Einstein, believed to be on the autistic spectrum. It will be on sale in over 30 countries within the coming year, and Hayden's dream is to one day get the doll into space. Hayden, who is obsessed with space travel, was largely non-verbal until he watched Tim Peake take off to the International Space Centre in December 2015. The doll designed in Hayden's honour be on sale in over 30 countries within the coming year, and Hayden's dream is to one day get the doll into space The doll, which wears a T-shirt emblazoned with 'Tesla, Einstein & Me' - a nod to genius scientists Nikola Tesla and Albert Einstein - is the first of its kind with autism and even comes with ear defenders and sunglasses He began shouting at the television: 'Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one... Blast off!' It was one of the first times mum Caroline, 41, had heard her little boy say a full sentence - and it triggered a rapid increase in his language skills. She said: 'The doll has the same headphones and clothes as Hayden so he really has put a lot of himself into the doll. 'The doll is there now for children across the world who might have autism. It also gets the message out there to children who don't. Hayden, pictured meeting Major Tim Peake, was non-verbal until he watched the astronaut take off to the International Space Centre in December 2015 Hayden's mum Caroline, 41, said it was one of the first times her little boy had spoken a full sentence - and it triggered a rapid increase in his language skills 'When I first looked at the doll I thought, ""That's the spitting image of Hayden"". 'Whenever we go to space conferences Hayden always wears the signature flight suit. 'He wears his ear defenders just to help shut out the stormy weather. He's amazed by the fact that boys and girls around the world can have a doll like him. 'It's helped him understand if you have an idea you can achieve anything.' Mum-of-one Caroline said she knew Hayden was 'different' from around 10 months old because he wasn't meeting common milestones or making eye contact. After battling with doctors for years, he was eventually diagnosed with autism aged five. Determined Hayden wrote to Lottie Dolls CEO Ian Harkin to tell him of the gap in the market, and got a response before the end of 2017 He learned Makaton at school - which combines signs, symbols and sounds - but aged around four he said his first sentence when he asked: 'What's the craic?' But Hayden struggled to speak fully - until he saw Tim Peake go into space in December 2015. Hayden sent astronaut Dr Niamh Shaw a painting of Mars, and she was so impressed she got in touch with the CEO of Lottie Dolls to tell them about Hayden. Hayden was sent three Lottie Dolls - a range of dolls which are inspired by children - and, after reading the leaflets inside each box, he realised there wasn't an autistic doll in the range.  Determined Hayden wrote to Lottie Dolls CEO Ian Harkin to tell him of the gap in the market, and got a response before the end of 2017. Both he and mum Caroline met with Ian in February 2018 and seven months later Finn Boy Doll was launched in the UK and Ireland. Caroline, a former fitness instructor, said: 'He was just transfixed by these dolls and his imagination would run away with him. 'When he read the leaflets he turned to me and said, ""I'd love to have one like me."" So we wrote to Lottie Dolls to tell them about Hayden's journey. 'He thought it'll be great to reach and inspire a wider audience with his story. With autism nothing is visual. In January, Hayden was awarded the title Planetary Defence Ambassador after impressing astronauts at Nasa's Human Exploration Research Analog 'When he went to the European Space Agency in October we bought six dolls with us. We handed them out but Hayden was dead set on giving one to Tim Peake. 'We know people in the circle now so we were able to pass it on to the right people. For two months Hayden would ask me, ""Have you heard anything from Tim, Mummy?"" 'He's based in Cologne and I know he is an extremely busy man. But two months later he sent a postcard which read: ""Hayden. Thank you for the Lottie Doll - keep doing amazing things! Tim Peake."" Hayden was over the moon.' The company behind Lottie Dolls does not outwardly highlight diversity on the packaging or marketing but anyone who buys the doll will find out more about Hayden. Hayden is the youngest member of Irish Astronomical Association and even has his own monthly column in Astronomy Ireland magazine Ian Harkin, co-founder and CEO of Lottie Dolls, said: 'We want kids to buy it first and foremost because it is a cool doll and they later discover inside the box that he has ear defenders (not headphones) a dog (which happens to be a service dog), communication cards and a pair of sunglasses because of light sensitivity. 'By playing with a diverse set of doll kids develop empathy and understanding of kids with disabilities and it normalises behaviour. 'We want all kids to have a diverse toy box, as much as its important for kids to see dolls that look just like them its important for other kids to learn about empathy. Hayden, pictured with Professor Brian Cox, is adamant to get the world's first autistic doll into outer space In June, space-mad Hayden will travel to Luxembourg to meet some of his space heroes having been personally invited to attend World Asteroid Day 'Hayden's doll will be on sale in over 30 countries within the coming year. 'We are huge fans of Hayden's work in promoting his love of astronomy and being a role model for other kids with Autism and ADHD.' In January, Hayden was awarded the title Planetary Defence Ambassador after impressing astronauts at Nasa's Human Exploration Research Analog. He is also the youngest member of Irish Astronomical Association and even has his own monthly column in Astronomy Ireland magazine.

That move will allow the European automaker to avoid paying hefty fines if it were to exceed the EU's emissions limit, which drops next year to 95g per kilometer. In the most recent year available, FCA's carbon output averaged 115 per kilometer, according to official statistics. If FCA does not meet the EU limit it could face up to 2 billion euros in fines, Jefferies analysts estimate, according to the FT. Shares of Tesla rose about 2.7% in early trading Monday after the deal was announced. FCA was also up about 2%. No specifics were offered about how many cars Fiat will add to its existing fleet beyond the ""hundreds of millions of euros"" figure.

Beginning next year, new European Commission rules begin to phase in that require a car maker's fleet-wide emissions to average no higher than 95g/CO2/km—a figure that works out at roughly 57mpg for gasoline vehicles, or 76mpg for diesel-powered vehicles. From 2020, 95 percent of an automaker's new cars sold in the EU have to meet this target, with the remaining 5 percent falling under the law in 2021. And the penalties for failing are draconian: a €95 ($107) ""excess emissions premium"" per gram of CO2 over the target, for every single car registered in the EU that year. For some OEMs, this has the potential to be ruinous; if FCA's portfolio were the same in 2021 as it was in 2018, the automaker would have to pay some €2.77 billion ($3.12 billion), out of total net global profits of €3.63 billion ($4.1 billion). Some OEMs are going all-out in their efforts to electrify in order to meet the new rules; VW's Roadmap E should be viewed in this context, for example. But for others, the road to electrification is not so simple. Although FCA announced a bold, €9 billion ($10.5 billion) plan to electrify its lineup by 2022, its actual plug-in portfolio is currently limited to the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid (which is not sold in the EU) and the Fiat 500e, a car thought to lose the brand many thousands of dollars for each one sold. Although the exact financial terms of the deal are unknown, the FT says the agreement is in the range of ""hundreds of millions of euros."" Interestingly, the FT also reports that Tesla had extended the offer to other OEMs to join this emissions pool but that none had accepted by the March 25th deadline. For Tesla, this will no doubt be a welcome financial lifeline. Each of Tesla's four profitable quarters since the company was founded in 2003 have depended heavily upon the sale of Zero Emissions Credits in California. Although the company has yet to release its results for Q1 2019, we do know that it suffered a precipitous drop in sales during the first three months of the year, particularly among the high-margin Model S and Model X electric cars.

Furthermore, the company has had to dip into its cash reserves to meet a hefty $920 million bond payment, with more debt coming due soon. And if that wasn't enough, the company needs to develop and then build the Model Y electric crossover, which will require heavy investment in capital expenditures. (This kind of spending has fallen heavily of late as Tesla has slashed its budget wherever it can in an attempt to improve its financial performance for the market.) However, it's unlikely to be a long-term panacea; at some point, FCA's electrification has to happen (or it has to withdraw from selling vehicles in the EU). In the meantime, it now needs Tesla to sell as many EVs in Europe as it possibly can.",tesla sells european emissions law lifeline fiat chrysler,weekend financial times reported tesla fiat chrysler automobiles fca entered agreement deliver tesla fresh influx cash deliver fca hands europe tough new emissions regulations beginning next year new european commission rules begin phase require car maker emissions average higher figure works roughly gasoline vehicles vehicles percent automaker new cars sold eu meet target remaining percent falling law penalties failing draconian excess emissions premium per gram target every single car registered eu year oems potential ruinous fca portfolio automaker would pay billion billion total net global profits billion billion oems going efforts electrify order meet new rules vw roadmap e viewed context example others road electrification simple although fca announced bold billion billion plan electrify lineup actual portfolio currently limited chrysler pacifica hybrid sold eu fiat car thought lose brand many thousands dollars one sold although exact financial terms deal unknown ft says agreement range hundreds millions euros interestingly ft also reports tesla extended offer oems join emissions pool none accepted march deadline tesla doubt welcome financial lifeline tesla four profitable quarters since company founded depended heavily upon sale zero emissions credits california although company yet release results know suffered precipitous drop sales first three months year particularly among model model x electric cars reading tesla lays thousands workers corporate restructuring furthermore company dip cash reserves meet hefty million bond payment debt coming due soon enough company needs develop build model electric crossover require heavy investment capital expenditures kind spending fallen heavily late tesla slashed budget wherever attempt improve financial performance market however unlikely panacea point fca electrification happen withdraw selling vehicles eu meantime needs tesla sell many evs europe possibly

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas lowered his price target on Tesla from $260 to $240 a share, and cut forecasts for a number of key financial metrics, including earnings, revenues, cash flow and gross margins after the company reported disappointing first-quarter deliveries last week. Jonas has the equivalent of a neutral rating on the stock. Tesla shares were up nearly 1 percent Monday in morning trading. The stock has lost more than 17 percent of its value since the beginning of the year. Apart from declining deliveries, negative sentiment around Tesla's stock also could begin to hurt the company's actual business, Jonas said. ""We are increasingly concerned about the impact that investor concerns over Tesla's financial strength and forward looking liquidity position could potentially have on employee morale, customer perceptions and standing with key stakeholders and suppliers,"" he said. Jonas now expects Tesla to deliver 344,000 vehicles in 2019, which is at the low end of Tesla's own guidance and down from Jonas' previous forecast of 362,000 units. He expects Tesla to deliver an average of 14,800 Model S and X vehicles per quarter and 287,500 Model 3 midsize sedans for the year.",morgan stanley cuts tesla price target lowers model model x sales forecast,morgan stanley cut tesla price target monday saying expects automaker deliver fewer vehicles especially model sedan model x sport utility vehicle morgan stanley analyst adam jonas lowered price target tesla share cut forecasts number key financial metrics including earnings revenues cash flow gross margins company reported disappointing deliveries last week jonas equivalent neutral rating stock tesla shares nearly percent monday morning trading stock lost percent value since beginning year apart declining deliveries negative sentiment around tesla stock also could begin hurt company actual business jonas said increasingly concerned impact investor concerns tesla financial strength forward looking liquidity position could potentially employee morale customer perceptions standing key stakeholders suppliers said jonas expects tesla deliver vehicles low end tesla guidance jonas previous forecast units expects tesla deliver average model x vehicles per quarter model midsize sedans year

Tesla is apparently planning an upgrade and we have the Model 3 to thank for it. As Electrek reports, both the Model S and X use AC induction electric motors, which achieve an efficiency of 93 percent. However, for the more recently developed Model 3, Tesla switched to using permanent magnet reluctance motors, which achieve an efficiency of 97 percent. Higher efficiency means more range from the same batteries. With that in mind, Tesla is thought to be planning a motor upgrade for both the Model S and X in the second half of 2019. The new motors are codenamed ""Raven,"" and as you'd expect, they switch to using permanent magnetic reluctance. It should result in both models of the electric vehicle enjoying a longer range. The efficiency gain is expected to be even greater in stop-and-go traffic, which is great news for those who drive the busiest routes each day. Tesla has also started upgrading its superchargers to a new V3 standard. They allows for 50 percent fasting charging, with the Model S and X receiving an over-the-air software update to add support.

Gaming — which has grown immensely popular in recent years — could be one such activity. The bigger picture:Gaming will likely become a critical part of how automakers differentiate their in-car entertainment offerings. In a future where companies sell or operate fleets of AVs and all other factors — including price, availability, and self-driving tech capabilities — the in-car experience could be a key competitive differentiator. Gaming is only one of a variety of entertainment options companies are exploring for use in AVs — VR and video streaming will also likely be marquee features — but its popularity suggests that it will be a key focus for auto companies as they seek to develop unique offerings. As such, we expect more AV companies to form partnerships with name-brand gaming companies or reach out to previously untapped sources to develop — and ultimately monetize — new games for their cars, the way Tesla and Mercedes have.

The company said in a statement on Monday it ""continues to vigorously deny the allegations of wrongdoing made in this lawsuit"" and said the settlement is ""completely covered by the company's insurance."" Investors sued in 2015, charging that the company misled them by asserting that Fiat Chrysler was in compliance with vehicle safety regulations and that the company under-reported its reserves for the cost of recalls. In 2015, Fiat Chrysler settled allegations with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it failed to properly complete 23 recalls affecting more than 11 million vehicles. It paid a $105 million U.S. penalty, conducted additional recalls and agreed to buy back hundreds of thousands of vehicles. The securities suit also raised claims Fiat Chrysler misled investors over the Justice Department's allegations it used defeat devices to allow diesel-powered vehicles to emit excess emissions. $800M settlement for using illegal software In January, Fiat Chrysler agreed to an $800-million settlement to resolve claims by the U.S. Justice Department and the state of California that it used illegal software to produce false results on diesel-emissions tests. The lawsuit covers investors who bought Fiat Chrysler stock on a U.S. exchange between Oct. 13, 2014 and May 23, 2017. Lawyers for the investors estimated in a court filing that the settlement is equal to 13.8 per cent of maximum damages, calling it ""an objectively excellent result when compared to historical statistics in class action settlements."" In the EU, Fiat Chrysler has struck a deal with Tesla to help it meet new emissions criteria that take effect next year. It will pay electric carmaker Tesla Inc hundreds of millions of euros to allow Tesla vehicles to be counted in its fleet to avoid fines for excess emissions of greenhouse gases. The EU rules allow companies to pool all their operations together, or strike partnerships with other automakers to reduce their average emissions limit to 95 g per kilometre. Tesla has made over $1 billion in the last three years by selling emissions credits in the United States, according to its annual report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.",fiat pay investors said deceived diesel,automaker fiat chrysler automobiles nv agreed pay million us settle lawsuit alleging misled investors excess diesel emissions failed comply federal safety regulations court records show company said statement monday continues vigorously deny allegations wrongdoing made lawsuit said settlement completely covered company insurance investors sued charging company misled asserting fiat chrysler compliance vehicle safety regulations company reserves cost recalls fiat chrysler settled allegations national highway traffic safety administration failed properly complete recalls affecting million vehicles paid million penalty conducted additional recalls agreed buy back hundreds thousands vehicles securities suit also raised claims fiat chrysler misled investors justice department allegations used defeat devices allow vehicles emit excess emissions settlement using illegal software january fiat chrysler agreed settlement resolve claims justice department state california used illegal software produce false results tests lawsuit covers investors bought fiat chrysler stock exchange may lawyers investors estimated court filing settlement equal per cent maximum damages calling objectively excellent result compared historical statistics class action settlements eu fiat chrysler struck deal tesla help meet new emissions criteria take effect next year pay electric carmaker tesla inc hundreds millions euros allow tesla vehicles counted fleet avoid fines excess emissions greenhouse gases eu rules allow companies pool operations together strike partnerships automakers reduce average emissions limit g per kilometre tesla made billion last three years selling emissions credits united states according annual report securities exchange commission

Read more: The biggest question for Tesla is whether the company can make steady profits on its cars The electric-car maker said in February that it would close many of its stores and convert the remaining stores into galleries and information centers as it shifts to an online-only sales model. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the move would lead to layoffs during a conference call that followed the announcement. Tesla partially reversed the store closures in March, saying it would ""keep significantly more stores open than previously announced."" Musk later said in a March email to employees that the best-performing stores would remain open, while those that did not generate sufficient revenue would be closed, adding that Tesla would use a similar strategy to evaluate salespeople. The April 4 cuts came the day after Tesla announced first-quarter delivery numbers that represented a 31% decrease from the prior quarter and fell below analyst estimates, but were a 110% increase from the first quarter of 2018. Since late 2018, Tesla has made significant changes to the incentive plans for its salespeople. The company has undergone multiple rounds of layoffs over the past year. Have you worked for Tesla?

So perhaps it should come as no surprise that one local chapter of his administration has proposed doing the same at the annual arts and culture gathering known as Burning Man. The Nevada branch of the Bureau of Land Management, which administers the Black Rock desert where Burning Man has been held since 1990, released in March a wildly unusual proposal calling for major changes to the event's permit. These include making the Burning Man organization pay for a private security force, as well as constructing a 10-mile, 19,000,000-pound concrete barrier around the weeklong event. The 372-page BLM proposal, if implemented, ""would forever negatively change the fabric of the Burning Man event, if not outright kill it,"" the Burning Man Project wrote in response last week. It estimated BLM's requirements would cost a total of $20 million every year, raising the price of tickets — which average around $400 — by $286 apiece. ""BLM would benefit financially from these increased expenses,"" the organization added, noting that the bureau takes a percentage cut from each ticket. It calls the proposals ""beyond excessive government oversight."" Burning Man, also known as Black Rock City, proudly proclaims itself the world's largest ""Leave No Trace"" event. It runs a Department of Public Works that walks every inch of the permit space for months after the event, also cleans up the nearby road, and disinvites groups that perform poorly on its environmental impact assessment — as the highly exclusive Camp Humano found out to its chagrin earlier this year. The notion of picking up after yourself is so baked into the event's core principles that MOOP — Matter Out of Place — is the ultimate insult for attendees, also known as Burners. When a camp that brought a Boeing 747 was delayed by a few weeks in moving the plane to private land last year, angry Burners returned to the playa just to spray-paint ""MOOP"" on its undercarriage. Oblivious to the event's success at encouraging attendees to pack everything out, the BLM proposes surrounding and filling Black Rock City with dumpsters. It also wants to replace the organization's MOOP-catching trash fence with a concrete barrier — one that is actually less likely to catch trash. ""Hardened physical perimeter barriers, such as jersey barriers [a modular concrete wall, usually used to separate lanes of traffic] or K-rail fencing, would reduce the risk of vehicle entry through perimeter fencing,"" the BLM report says. This is, however, a solution in search of a problem. There have been no reports of vehicles attempting to enter via the fence in recent years. Which isn't surprising to anyone who has seen the situation on the ground. Only one access road, Gate Road, allows safe entry to the event without the strong possibility of getting your car stuck in the dust, or being caught by the event's radar- and night-vision enabled Perimeter team. Nor would the wall proposal adversely affect any theoretical illegal migration into the event. ""It's actually easier to climb over a concrete barrier than a taut 10-mile trash fence,"" says one veteran Burning Man volunteer. The Burning Man organization doesn't mince words about the barrier proposal, which it calls ""logistically onerous, environmentally irresponsible, unnecessarily redundant, prohibitively expensive.""  Instead of allowing wind and dust to blow through the space, it says, a wall would create 10 miles of dunes that would ""need to be remediated with heavy machinery"" — an odd requirement for a bureau that claims to care about the desert. Speaking of the environment, the BLM branch report says the art at Burning Man shouldn't use lasers at night because of the risk to migratory birds — even though none appear during the summer, and never migrate by night. The event has its own volunteer force of Black Rock Rangers, who for decades have worked alongside local Nevada sheriffs and official BLM Rangers. Nevertheless, the BLM proposal calls for ""private security at all portals of entry to screen participants, staff, and volunteers entering the event"" and to ""report weapons and illegal drugs directly to law enforcement as violations are observed."" Burning Man argues that this constitutes a fourth amendment violation, since the only ""probable cause"" offered as a reason for widespread searches is that the targets are attending Burning Man. As attendees know, the Gate Road line for entry (which already include a cursory search of each vehicle) have been known at busy times to take as long as 12 hours to get through. ""The delay from this private security operation would cause entrance times to be extended by days,"" the Burning Man organization writes. ""Not hours, days."" [Emphasis theirs.] Rumors abounded in 2017 that the Trump administration would attempt to close the event because it was a favorite destination for west-coast liberals. However, Black Rock City is also home to conservative defenders such as Grover Norquist and business leaders such as Elon Musk, who famously co-founded SolarCity at Burning Man 2004 and brought a prototype Tesla Roadster to Burning Man 2007. Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are longtime attendees, and hired their first CEO, Eric Schmidt, purely on the basis that he had been to Burning Man. Now the Burners — this loose-knit coalition of punks, hippies, libertarians and Silicon Valley utopians — are being invited to fight back. April 29 is the deadline for public comments on the BLM's proposal, which can be submitted online here. The Burning Man Project has produced a guide for making those comments as substantive and effective as possible. Because if building a 2,000 mile wall across the entire U.S. southern border makes no sense, the same goes for a 10-mile wall around the country's most temporary — and self-reliant — city.",trump administration wants build wall around burning man,donald trump main policy initiative involves building pointless wall across miles empty desert perhaps come surprise one local chapter administration proposed annual arts culture gathering known burning man nevada branch bureau land management administers black rock desert burning man held since released march wildly unusual proposal calling major changes event permit include making burning man organization pay private security force well constructing concrete barrier around weeklong event blm proposal implemented would forever negatively change fabric burning man event outright kill burning man project wrote response last week estimated blm requirements would cost total million every year raising price tickets average around apiece blm would benefit financially increased expenses organization added noting bureau takes percentage cut ticket calls proposals beyond excessive government oversight burning man also known black rock city proudly proclaims world largest leave trace event runs department public works walks every inch permit space months event also cleans nearby road disinvites groups perform poorly environmental impact assessment highly exclusive camp humano found chagrin earlier year notion picking baked event core principles moop matter place ultimate insult attendees also known burners camp brought boeing delayed weeks moving plane private land last year angry burners returned playa moop undercarriage oblivious event success encouraging attendees pack everything blm proposes surrounding filling black rock city dumpsters also wants replace organization trash fence concrete barrier one actually less likely catch trash hardened physical perimeter barriers jersey barriers modular concrete wall usually used separate lanes traffic fencing would reduce risk vehicle entry perimeter fencing blm report says however solution search problem reports vehicles attempting enter via fence recent years surprising anyone seen situation ground one access road gate road allows safe entry event without strong possibility getting car stuck dust caught event enabled perimeter team would wall proposal adversely affect theoretical illegal migration event actually easier climb concrete barrier taut trash fence says one veteran burning man volunteer burning man organization mince words barrier proposal calls logistically onerous environmentally irresponsible unnecessarily redundant prohibitively expensive instead allowing wind dust blow space says wall would create miles dunes would need remediated heavy machinery odd requirement bureau claims care desert speaking environment blm branch report says art burning man use lasers night risk migratory birds even though none appear summer never migrate night event volunteer force black rock rangers decades worked alongside local nevada sheriffs official blm rangers nevertheless blm proposal calls private security portals entry screen participants staff volunteers entering event report weapons illegal drugs directly law enforcement violations observed burning man argues constitutes fourth amendment violation since probable cause offered reason widespread searches targets attending burning man attendees know gate road line entry already include cursory search vehicle known busy times take long hours get delay private security operation would cause entrance times extended days burning man organization writes hours days emphasis rumors abounded trump administration would attempt close event favorite destination liberals however black rock city also home conservative defenders grover norquist business leaders elon musk famously solarcity burning man brought prototype tesla roadster burning man google founders larry page sergey brin longtime attendees hired first ceo eric schmidt purely basis burning man burners coalition punks hippies libertarians silicon valley utopians invited fight back april deadline public comments blm proposal submitted online burning man project produced guide making comments substantive effective possible building mile wall across entire southern border makes sense goes wall around country temporary city

ABC7 News reported Tuesday that Tesla Model 3 owner Jed Franklin alerted the police after getting a notice that Sentry Mode has been triggered, along with a ""full view"" of a man breaking into a backseat window of his Tesla, parked in San Francisco. With the help of the video, the San Francisco Police managed to apprehend the burglar,  the 21-year old Jeremiah Jefferson, who is under arrest on second-degree burglary charges, as well as probation violation. Tesla launched Sentry Mode in February, offering it to owners of the Model 3 as well as owners of the Model S and Model X cars built after August 2017. Sentry Mode is similar to a home alarm. When enabled, it first goes into Standby mode, and uses the car's external cameras to detect threats. If it detects a ""minimal"" threat, such as someone leaning on the car, it goes into Alert state and displays a message on the car's screen, warning that cameras are recording. If the car detects someone breaking in, it goes into Alarm state, increasing the brightness on the display and playing music on maximum volume. It also sends a message to the owner and lets them download a video recording of the incident. The ABC7 News' report says that Franklin got ""stunningly clear video"" of the incident. And while Sentry Mode didn't deter this particular burglar from breaking into the car, Franklin says he's happy that he was able to help the police catch him. ""I was upset to see the car getting broken into but on the other side, I was like, oh my gosh I can't believe this is actually recorded,"" he said.",tesla sentry mode helps police find burglar,man breaking tesla got plans foiled company new sentry mode takes video car surroundings sensing threat news reported tuesday tesla model owner jed franklin alerted police getting notice sentry mode triggered along full view man breaking backseat window tesla parked san francisco help video san francisco police managed apprehend burglar old jeremiah jefferson arrest burglary charges well probation violation tesla launched sentry mode february offering owners model well owners model model x cars built august sentry mode similar home alarm enabled first goes standby mode uses car external cameras detect threats detects minimal threat someone leaning car goes alert state displays message car screen warning cameras recording car detects someone breaking goes alarm state increasing brightness display playing music maximum volume also sends message owner lets download video recording incident news report says franklin got stunningly clear video incident sentry mode deter particular burglar breaking car franklin says happy able help police catch upset see car getting broken side like oh gosh ca believe actually recorded said

The Twitter CEO took home just $1.40 as his salary in 2018 to run the social network, according to a company filing published late on Monday. He declined all other compensation and benefits for the year. The paltry salary is in keeping with previous years, when Dorsey declined to take any payment at all. The $1.40 figure may be symbolic too, given Twitter's origin as a service for posting updates of 140 characters, now extended to 280 characters. Read more: Here's proof that a big source of Apple's App Store growth tanked, probably thanks to Netflix The filing says: ""As a testament to his commitment to and belief in Twitter's long-term value creation potential, our CEO, Jack Dorsey, declined all compensation and benefits for 2015, 2016 and 2017, and in 2018 he declined all compensation and benefits other than a salary of $1.40."" Twitter This doesn't mean Dorsey is poor, however. According to a 2017 filing, he holds more than 16 million Twitter shares, worth $557 million at Tuesday's share price. He also earns money from his second job as CEO of the payments firm Square. Through 2018, he offloaded Square stock worth a total of $80 million, Forbes reported, citing regulatory filings. He isn't the only Silicon Valley heavyweight to decline a salary. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg takes an annual salary of $1, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he won't accept a paycheck until his firm hits a $100 billion market cap. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel also earns $1, though he takes stock compensation and other benefits. The idea behind the low salaries is to show that these CEOs, all of whom are major shareholders in their firm, have faith in their company. Ev Williams, Twitter's cofounder and another major shareholder, took $275,000 as his fee in 2018 and sold off Twitter stock through the year, according to the filing. Twitter said in February that Williams was stepping off the board. Another board member, the British entrepreneur Martha Lane Fox, took home $70,000 in fees and stock awards worth $225,000. Patrick Pichette, the former Google chief financial officer, earned $80,000 in fees and $225,000 in stock awards.

It rolled out in February, and it's already earning its keep. According to ABC 7 news, the feature has resulted in the arrest of a would-be thief. San Francisco-based Jed Franklin received an alert on his phone informing him that Sentry Mode had been activated. On arriving at his vehicle, he found that the window had been broken, but that the perp had fled empty-handed. Franklin then downloaded the video captured by Sentry Mode, which had recorded a clear image of the suspect's face and license plate number. He turned it over to the police, who were able to make an arrest. Tesla is a desirable brand, so its vehicles are obviously going to be a target for criminals. The arrival of Sentry Mode means we'll probably be hearing a lot more about attempted break-ins in the coming weeks, but this publicity will eventually act as a deterrent itself.

Profits at the FTSE 250 company fell by 63 per cent, in part because of the cost of paying out millions of dollars in compensation to thousands of employees in the US who got no meal or rest breaks. In the UK, where it runs four prisons and a secure training centre for young offenders, meanwhile it took a substantial hit after being stripped of a deal to run Birmingham Prison last August. It followed a scathing assessment of conditions at the institution issued by the Chief Inspector of Prisons. The company ended up shelling out £9.9m to cover costs associated with HM Prison & Probation Service stepping in to run the place and to cover essential maintenance work. G4S further faces lawsuits alleging staff were put at risk while working at one of Australia’s offshore immigration detention centres on Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island. These are just a selection fo the recent issues the company has faced. A look back through its cuttings reveals many more tales of woe. Given that, I was most interested to discover when I accessed the company’s investor relations website that it is a proud member of the FTSE4Good Index. “G4S’ commitment to social responsibility and sustainable business practices has been recognised by the FTSE4Good Index Series,” investors and potential investors are told. “This inclusion (for the second year running) recognises G4S’ strong commitment to social responsibility and to sustainable business practices across the group.” Quite how that squares with the stories I’ve listed might be an interesting discussion to have. Next to the FTSE4Good web page to see what it says. “The FTSE4Good Index Series is designed to measure the performance of companies demonstrating strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. “Transparent management and clearly-defined ESG criteria make FTSE4Good indexes suitable tools to be used by a wide variety of market participants when creating or assessing sustainable investment products.” Make of that what you will.",faced series scandals member,security outfit published annual report following less happy year terms finances operations profits ftse company fell per cent part cost paying millions dollars compensation thousands employees us got meal rest breaks uk runs four prisons secure training centre young offenders meanwhile took substantial hit stripped deal run birmingham prison last august followed scathing assessment conditions institution issued chief inspector prisons company ended shelling cover costs associated hm prison probation service stepping run place cover essential maintenance work faces lawsuits alleging staff put risk working one australia offshore immigration detention centres papua new guinea manus island selection fo recent issues company faced look back cuttings reveals many tales woe given interested discover accessed company investor relations website proud member index commitment social responsibility sustainable business practices recognised index series investors potential investors told inclusion second year running recognises strong commitment social responsibility sustainable business practices across quite squares stories listed might interesting discussion next web page see says index series designed measure performance companies demonstrating strong environmental social governance esg practices transparent management esg criteria make indexes suitable tools used wide variety market participants creating assessing sustainable investment make

The feature, which Tesla calls Enhanced Summon, lets drivers remotely call their car to drive itself through a parking lot to pick them up, so long as it's within 150 feet, according to Tesla. Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted Saturday that the feature, which has already been available in beta for some Tesla drivers, will be available within the week for any US Tesla owners who sprung for the Enhanced Autopilot, or ""Full Self-Driving,"" package (which adds an additional $5,000 to the overall cost of each car).  With Enhanced Summon, users will actually be able to tap a button in the Tesla mobile app to summon the vehicle, according to Electrek. The Tesla will drive on its own through a parking lot, maneuvering around objects in its path, toward its owner. The Tesla user will have the option of either selecting the ""Find Me"" option, which will bring the car directly to the owner using GPS, or they can drop a pin at a nearby location (again, in either case, the owner or the chosen location must be within 150 feet of where the Tesla is parked). Tesla users have already begun uploading videos showing their Tesla navigating a parking lot unassisted, but some critics have pointed out that the Enhanced Summon feature moves the car so slowly that it might not yet be as useful in real life as it sounds. Of course, Musk has made ambitious claims about his products before that haven't come to fruition. For instance, in 2016, Musk said a Tesla could drive itself (without a human driver) from Los Angeles to New York City by the end of 2017. Two years later, that still hasn't happened, though Musk claimed earlier this year that the trip could be completed by the end of 2019, if regulators approve. As for the Enhanced Summon feature, it builds off of the existing Summon feature from Tesla's Autopilot software, which allows users to remotely park their vehicle by moving it up to a few dozen feet forward or backward, using Tesla's mobile app. A Tesla spokesperson told CNBC Make It that the company is not sharing any further information on the Enhanced Summon feature rollout beyond Musk's comments on Twitter but did not immediately respond to further request for comment on the usefulness of the feature. While Enhanced Summon is currently only available in the US, Musk added in his tweet that Tesla is also working on versions of the Enhanced Summon feature for international markets, but Musk says that process has been slowed by the need to satisfy varying regulatory requirements around the world. Even in the US, federal law currently does not allow for driverless cars on public roadways (though the laws are evolving, and some states have started allowing more driverless car tests on public roads). And Tesla noted in a statement to Electrek, the Enhanced Summon feature is ""only intended for use in parking lots and driveways, not public roads."" And despite the ability of the Enhanced Summon feature to drive the car on its own on private roadways, Tesla's Autopilot software is not yet meant to be fully autonomous. The software can perform all driving functions in some circumstances but a human driver has to be ready at all times to take control of the vehicle.

Matthew DeBord: The Boring Company is owned almost entirely by Elon Musk. I mean, he owns 90% of the company. Boring Company is kind of at the level of a hobby for him right now, I think. Although as hobbies go, it could be worth billions of dollars. I don't think there have been any canceled projects, but I don't think there've really been any projects. We think we're gonna do something in Chicago. We're interested in doing something in Las Vegas. We've talked about doing something in New York. These are kinda still at the proposal and discussion stage, and this is actually not that unusual as far as big infrastructure projects go. An infrastructure project requires a lot of steps. I mean, a lot of people need to weigh in on what's gonna happen if you're gonna build a new freeway or a bridge. Much of what The Boring Company is doing at this point is setting itself up as, I think, just as a player in the space. They're not necessarily doing anything particularly advanced as far as the technology here. Rapidly being able to dig tunnels that vehicles or people can move through at high speeds is an antidote to the problem of gridlocking congestion in urban areas. The Boring Company itself is working on a tunneling machine that can operate at much higher speed, and I think the idea is it might be able to operate in kind of a drone-like way or a computerized way. Now as far as the projects are concerned, they've created a sample, like a test tunnel. It's a little over a mile long near SpaceX headquarters, and then there is the Chicago project. A high-speed Elon Musk-ified people mover to connect, in the case of Chicago, downtown with O'Hare Airport. The idea in Vegas is to move people around at higher speed, not so much a bunch of Boring Company tunnels that are gonna be running underneath freeways and are gonna provide you with maybe what the initial promise was. When they first rolled it out, they said, ""OK, what we're gonna have is essentially cars going down into these tunnels and getting on these high-speed sleds."" But the idea now is that we could have a, what people might recognize more as mass transit, where people would go down into the tunnel and get on some sort of sled that accommodates 20 people or 50 people or something like that, and that would move through the tunnel as opposed to it being one person in their car going down there and be able to bypass all the traffic. You know, the only thing that really is preventing these projects from moving forward is financing, public will, some kind of civic buy-in, then government support, I mean, you need a package to make this stuff happen. And then we'll also have to look at what are the environmental effects. Sounds to me like the Vegas tunnel is the closest one to actually happening. Vegas is kind of interested in doing this. It sounds to me like the Chicago tunnel was highly dependent on Mayor Rahm Emanuel being able to drive it through city council. Without him driving the project forward, there could be some issues with it. That's not to say it won't happen. It's just that sometimes, I don't know, it's something about the way things work in America that you need to have someone dropping in, parachuting in with some crazy, high-tech idea. It's like, ""Oh, this is a game changer. It's gonna change everything."" Instead of it taking, whatever, half an hour to 45 minutes to go from Manhattan out to JFK, you could do it in 15 minutes, and you're gonna be going 275 miles an hour, and you're not even gonna know it. So there is that aspect of it, and then there's the marketing value of it for Elon Musk's other companies. If Elon is out doing a project, a high-tech project that's gonna revolutionize tunneling, it continues the narrative of him being a revolutionary Silicon Valley problem-solver. The financing and political aspect of it is where all the tricky stuff comes into play. The places where that kind of financing would be available are typically large urban areas where the political aspects of such a project are gonna be quite complicated. People might be concerned that boring tunnels underneath where they live is gonna geologically destabilize their area. Of the companies that he's created, the one that is gonna have the most challenges actually getting anything, well, fulfilling some of its more ambitious objectives is probably gonna be The Boring Company, ironically. If The Boring Company does grow, and they sign up some real contracts and start doing some real projects, then there might be some significant follow-on investment, and I've seen people talking about valuations of anywhere from $10 billion to $20 billion in that ballpark. They have discovered that by selling merch, they can raise quite a bit of money. So the first thing they did were they did the hats, Boring Company hats, and I think they raised something like $5 billion, million dollars, some ridiculous amount of money on just hats. Then they did these flamethrowers. At the moment, I think what would take it out of, you know, Elon Musk's big hobby is the financing, right? So when they get to the point that they are actually talking about doing some projects, there'll be large sums of money attached to that. That money will represent revenue to The Boring Company. So once we start seeing that dynamic take over where the business becomes capitalized outside of the founder, then you have a real company. I'd say it's still a pretty glorious hobby at this point for Elon Musk, but I think that because they're making progress and are sort of working out the kinks in the technology and all that kind of stuff, that it's becoming more of a real thing. And if they do a project in Vegas in particular, then I think everybody will go, ""Ah, well, this is for real. This isn't just an amusing name for a company. It's an actual business doing actual things in the actual world."" Digging a tunnel, eh? Didn't we do that 100 and something years ago? I drive through the Lincoln Tunnel every day.

But it is one that carries an intriguing twist. The story first, then the twist. Back in the 1950s Debenhams was Britain’s largest department store group. Its ownership changed several times but when it was floated on the stock market in 2006, it was valued at £1.6bn. Three years ago, after a tough decade, it was still worth nearly £1bn. Now its shareholders will probably get nothing. By putting the company in administration the board has ensured that the business carries on for the time being, but expect there to be a rapid decline in the number of outlets, and I am afraid job losses among its 27,000 staff. That is the first element of the story: another high street and shopping mall retailer that has been unseated by the shift to online. Debenhams did expand its online sales side but the legacy of all that property on expensive leases was too great a burden to carry. Maybe the management should have moved faster to cut costs. But given the whirlwind sweeping through the way we buy stuff, it would have required a retailing genius to have saved it. The second element to the story is society’s response. There is a practical question: what happens to Debenhams’ sites? Some will remain trading for a while at least, but long term we have to ask what is to be done with the high street and with shopping malls. As far as high streets are concerned, the pattern has been to provide services rather than sell goods. So shops become restaurants or hair salons. This has saved some well-run towns and cities, but many still struggle. As for shopping malls, the outlook is not good at all. It is estimated that in the US up to a quarter of all malls will close in the next five years and we should expect an equally swift decline here. Now the twist. This is a story about a business being slow to adapt to social change, but it is also a story about how one charismatic individual might have been able to change things. The individual is Mike Ashley, the controversial owner of Sports Direct, Newcastle United and, since last year, House of Fraser. He built up a substantial minority shareholding in Debenhams and has been involved in a public row with the board. He wanted to take full control of the group but the offers he made were rejected, and the board chose what is called prepackaged administration instead. There are two ways of looking at this. One is to focus on the personalities – the colourful self-made entrepreneur versus the hard-nosed financiers – and see this as a boardroom clash. It is certainly that. Boardroom battles do hit the headlines. But there is something else here that takes the story beyond the row. It is whether a commercial genius (and whatever you think of him, Mike Ashley is that) can rescue businesses that otherwise would fail. There are many other examples of individuals who seem to manage to break the rules.",debenhams brink retail genius hold back online tide,demise debenhams familiar story though sad one one carries intriguing twist story first twist back debenhams britain largest department store group ownership changed several times floated stock market valued three years ago tough decade still worth nearly shareholders probably get nothing putting company administration board ensured business carries time expect rapid decline number outlets afraid job losses among staff first element story another high street shopping mall retailer unseated shift online debenhams expand online sales side legacy property expensive leases great burden carry maybe management moved faster cut costs given whirlwind sweeping way buy stuff would required retailing genius saved second element story society response practical question happens debenhams sites remain trading least long term ask done high street shopping malls far high streets concerned pattern provide services rather sell goods shops become restaurants hair salons saved towns cities many still struggle shopping malls outlook good estimated us quarter malls close next five years expect equally swift decline twist story business slow adapt social change also story one charismatic individual might able change things individual mike ashley controversial owner sports direct newcastle united since last year house fraser built substantial minority shareholding debenhams involved public row board wanted take full control group offers made rejected board chose called prepackaged administration instead two ways looking one focus personalities colourful entrepreneur versus financiers see boardroom clash certainly boardroom battles hit headlines something else takes story beyond row whether commercial genius whatever think mike ashley rescue businesses otherwise would fail many examples individuals seem manage break rules

The FAA emergency order followed more than 50 nations and airlines that had also taken action, effectively grounding the entire global 737 Max fleet after two crashes in four months. At the same time, politicians and the flying public began to question how Boeing and the FAA could have let such a troubled aircraft enter service. Also on March 13, Germany's Lufthansa Group placed an order for 20 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners in a deal that could worth as much as $5.85 billion. Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr.

It was the first major-airline order placed with Boeing after the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET302. It was a show of support for the Chicago-based aviation giant from a longtime customer. ""It shows we are committed to our partners in difficult times,"" Lufthansa Group CEO Carsten Spohr told reporters at a recent lunch meeting in New York. ""We have not lost our trust in Boeing, they've built wonderful aircraft over the decades, and I'm sure they will fix the current issues."" Lufthansa Group includes such airlines as Austrian, Swiss, Brussels Air, Germanwings, Eurowings, and the eponymous Lufthansa. Read more: A timeline of Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET302 shows its pilots fighting desperately to save their doomed Boeing 737 Max jet. None of Lufthansa Group's brands operate the controversial 737 Max airliner, opting instead for the rival Airbus A320neo. However, Spohr revealed his airline will consider the 737 Max in a round of aircraft orders next year. Europe's largest airline also operates a wide variety of wide-body Boeing jets, including the 747, the 767, and the 777. In 1967, Lufthansa was the first airline to take delivery of the original 737-100. A Lufthansa Boeing 737-100.

While Boeing's reputation may remain intact, the Lufthansa CEO does foresee a major shift in the way regulatory bodies around the world will certify US-made aircraft in the years to come. ""When it comes to the certification, it's going to be interesting to see how the European authorities react to what has happened to the Max,"" Spohr said. ""Historically, if the FAA certified the aircraft, it was basically 'copy and paste' for the European authorities."" Read more:The 20 biggest airlines in the world, ranked. ""Overall, foreign authorities will be more thorough in accepting American certifications,"" Spohr added. ""I think that for me is one of the outputs of these terrible events in Indonesia and Ethiopia."" However, the Lufthansa boss did point out that regulators may be limited in their ability to be effective. ""We also have to be realistic, the aircraft these days are such high-tech machines that probably regulators cannot do what they did in the 1960s,"" Spohr told Business Insider. He said that the complexity of modern technology makes it very challenging for regulators to have an expert-level understanding of the innumerable systems that comprise a modern jetliner.

This is a problem all regulators will have to confront. Despite of the increased scrutiny international regulators will place on US-made aircraft, Spohr said that the FAA's place as the elite aviation-regulatory body will remain unchanged. ""The FAA is the most advanced agency in the world so I think we'll be watching what comes out from the investigations here and that probably will be the new standard around the world,"" the Lufthansa CEO told Business Insider.",lufthansa ceo reveals biggest change airline industry caused boeing max scandal,march three days crash ethiopian airlines flight us federal aviation administration faa issued emergency order ground boeing max aircraft us faa emergency order followed nations airlines also taken action effectively grounding entire global max fleet two crashes four months time politicians flying public began question boeing faa could let troubled aircraft enter service also march germany lufthansa group placed order boeing dreamliners deal could worth much billion lufthansa ceo carsten spohr alexander images first order placed boeing crash ethiopian airlines flight show support aviation giant longtime customer shows committed partners difficult times lufthansa group ceo carsten spohr told reporters recent lunch meeting new york lost trust boeing built wonderful aircraft decades sure fix current issues lufthansa group includes airlines austrian swiss brussels air germanwings eurowings eponymous lufthansa read timeline ethiopian airlines flight shows pilots fighting desperately save doomed boeing max jet none lufthansa group brands operate controversial max airliner opting instead rival airbus however spohr revealed airline consider max round aircraft orders next year europe largest airline also operates wide variety boeing jets including lufthansa first airline take delivery original lufthansa boeing lufthansa boeing reputation may remain intact lufthansa ceo foresee major shift way regulatory bodies around world certify aircraft years come comes certification going interesting see european authorities react happened max spohr said historically faa certified aircraft basically paste european authorities read biggest airlines world ranked overall foreign authorities thorough accepting american certifications spohr added think one outputs terrible events indonesia ethiopia however lufthansa boss point regulators may limited ability effective also realistic aircraft days machines probably regulators spohr told business insider said complexity modern technology makes challenging regulators understanding innumerable systems comprise modern jetliner lufthansa boeing lufthansa problem regulators confront despite increased scrutiny international regulators place aircraft spohr said faa place elite body remain unchanged faa advanced agency world think watching comes investigations probably new standard around world lufthansa ceo told business insider

Mr. Musk said his actions and rapid decision-making can be misunderstood as erratic behavior. “It is better to make many decisions per unit time with a slightly higher error rate, than few with a slightly lower error rate,” he said last weekend in a series of emails with The Wall Street Journal, “because obviously one of your future right decisions can be to reverse an earlier wrong one, provided the earlier one was not catastrophic, which they rarely are.” This approach makes a certain amount of sense when you're running a startup fighting for survival.

Musk apparently didn't anticipate the backlash that would be created by last month's decision to offer customers discounts on the full self-driving packages without offering partial refunds to those who had already pre-ordered the technology. He also seems to have offered full self-driving customers admission to the early access program without checking to see if the program could accommodate an influx of new users.

Up until that point, it hadn't fully hit her: she just had her third miscarriage. And under the bright lights of the operating room at the Women's Center at Sharp Grossmont in La Mesa, California, a Southern California city less than 10 miles from downtown San Diego, doctors meticulously performed a dilation and curettage procedure to remove any lingering tissue from her pregnancy. In the weeks prior to the D&C, Brandt, who was 31-years-old at the time, and her husband, were cautiously optimistic about the pregnancy. She knew she had a history of miscarriages, but she also grew hopeful as time continued to progress and everything appeared to be going smoothly. Brandt and her husband desperately wanted to start a family. During a routine ultrasound examination, however, doctors discovered no heartbeat. They told her they needed to schedule a D&C procedure. Brandt was devastated. In the weeks after the D&C, Brandt grieved the loss of her child; she felt ashamed and angry at the world for her fertility struggles. ""Why are we having all these troubles? We're healthy, we're doing everything the right way, why are we having all these troubles when other people don't seem to be having any problems?"" Brandt told INSIDER. ""There's those things you go through in your mind that eat at you when you're grieving from a miscarriage."" And then she found out that the procedure at the Sharp Grossmont facility had secretly been filmed. A recent lawsuit in California, for which Brandt is a plaintiff, claims the Women's Health Center at Sharp Grossmont Hospital secretly recorded around 1,800 women between July 2012 and June 2013 as they underwent a range of gynecological procedures, including Caesarean births, D&Cs after miscarriages, hysterectomies, and sterilizations. They claim their faces — and therefore their identities — were exposed in the videos. In total, the hospital's surveillance system generated nearly 7,000 video clips. ""The recordings captured women while they were emotionally and physically exposed, and at their most vulnerable,"" the complaint, filed in March, states. ""At times, Defendants' patients had their most sensitive genital areas visible."" An empty operating room from a secret video recording at Sharp Grossmont Hospital.
Declaration of Duane Admire INSIDER reviewed almost 400 pages of legal files related to this story. The earliest documents date to a 2016 lawsuit against the hospital that its' plaintiff, a former patient, later dismissed for personal reasons. A subsequent lawsuit, filed in 2017 on similar grounds, failed to obtain class-action certification after the assigned judge ruled that each potential plaintiff needed to individually prove their damages. In March, a group of 81 former Sharp patients filed their own lawsuit in California's Superior Court of San Diego to do just that. Allison Goddard, the attorney representing the plaintiffs, said that 50 more women joined the lawsuit this week — bringing the total to 131 women. ""For some of these women, it was the day that they gave birth to a healthy child, and that was one of the happiest days of their lives. But, for a lot of these women, it was the saddest day of their lives,"" Goddard told INSIDER. ""[The women] are scared, they're worried about who's seen the videos and whether anyone has done anything with them. It's really shaken their faith and trust in the medical system."" Sharp HealthCare, the company that oversees Sharp Grossmont Hospital, said in a statement that a computer monitor with a motion-activated camera was installed in the three Women's Center operating rooms — meant to uncover what happened to drugs missing from anesthesia carts. ""Although the cameras were intended to record only individuals in front of the anesthesia carts, others, including patients and medical personnel in the operating rooms, were at times visible to the cameras and recorded without sound,"" the statement said. ""We sincerely apologize that our efforts may have caused any distress to the women who were recorded, their families, and others we serve. We can assure you this surveillance method is no longer in use, and we have made changes in our protocols to ensure this situation is not repeated."" While Sharp claims that the cameras were installed solely to find the culprit of the missing drugs — a sedative called Propofol — there are discrepancies in the hospital's version of events. According to the legal documents filed by Goddard on behalf of her clients, the hospital continued to film for two months after they had identified the doctor, anesthesiologist Adam Dorin, who they claimed stole the drugs. The hospital confronted Dorin in April 2013, after recording 15 incidents in which he put drugs in his pocket between September 2002 and March 2013. Filming continued, though, for several months after the confrontation, according to a 2017 deposition of Sharp's Director of Security Raymond Albright. Albright said that there was no purpose to continue recording women at that point. ""If they worry about their patients, why would they let the doctor abusing drugs continue to give patients the anesthesia? Can you imagine the conversation with a patient: 'we think your doctor might be stealing your drug?'"" Goddard said. The Medical Board of California ultimately dropped its charges against Dorin in 2016. Duane Admire, Dorin's attorney during that case, told INSIDER that the video clips exonerated his client: not only did they show other doctors removing medication from the drug carts, he said they also included footage of Dorin placing the drugs back on the cart after using them to treat patients. planned cesarean delivery
BSIP/UIG via Getty Images Other anesthesiologists have claimed that it was common for staff to take drugs, like Propofol, to complete their surgeries, due to a national drug shortage at the time. Patrick Sullivan, an anesthesiologist who worked at Sharp, has spoken out about how doctors took drugs from the carts at the Women's Center to use in other parts of the hospital. According to exhibits filed in the case, only four vials of Propofol went missing between May and September 2012. (The same exhibit indicates a total of 54 vials disappeared during the same time period, but an itemized list of the missing medicine seems to add up to just 53 vials.) Admire told INSIDER that he believes the hospital deliberately targeted Dorin because he acted as a whistleblower in a malpractice case that he said ultimately cost the hospital a hefty sum. Dorin resigned from the hospital in October 2013. Sharp Healthcare put out a statement in 2016 that they were ""pleased"" with the Medical Board of California's decision regarding Dorin, adding that ""we are confident that the Board conducted a thorough evaluation and support their decision on this matter."" Yet, in last week's statement, the hospital stood by its story that the cameras were used to identify employees stealing drugs. ""They made it sound like they caught a drug thief, which is just not true,"" Admire said. Sullivan, the anesthesiologist, complained during his tenure at Sharp about the use of cameras in operating rooms. After Sharp refused to remove the cameras, he said that he began to cover the lenses with tape before performing procedures. In a statement drafted by his attorney, Sullivan claimed he left the hospital in 2016 after allegedly facing retaliation for complaining about the use of cameras in the operating rooms. Sullivan's 2017 wrongful-termination lawsuit against his former employer remains ongoing. Albright, the hospital's director of security, said in the 2017 deposition that Michele Tarbet, the former CEO of Sharp Grossmont Hospital, who died in 2014, directed him to place the cameras in the operating rooms. ""I never used — would put any type of surveillance in a patient care area in that context… so that's what I discussed with [Tarbet],"" Albright said. ""And she told me there are no issues. Because people sign a waiver when they go in there. And so that was — that was my discussion with her."" But Brandt said that she was never made aware of cameras in the operating room. INSIDER reached out to Sharp about these specific concerns. John Cihomsky, Vice President of Public Relations and Communications at Sharp HealthCare, referred INSIDER to an article from the San Diego Union-Tribune. Dan Gross, Sharp's executive vice president of hospital operations, told the newspaper that the intent was never to record patients, and that it was always about monitoring personnel who were accessing medication in the anesthesia carts. He added that the hospital has since changed its video policy so that cameras can never be placed where patients receive treatment. Cihomsky told INSIDER that as an active legal matter, they are unable to answer other questions at this time. Goddard's lawsuit also targets the way that Sharp handled the video recordings of these women. The recent complaint alleges that the hospital was ""grossly negligent in maintaining the recordings,"" adding that, ""the recordings were stored on desktop computers that could be accessed by multiple users, some without the need for a password. Sharp did not log or track who accessed the recordings, why, or when."" A male member of Sharp's security staff said in a November 2016 deposition that, ""I could see the patient's faces when they came in and when they left. On some of the videos I could see the backside, buttocks area as they're getting onto the tables briefly. I could see the backside sometimes on a video when the anesthesia may be given an injection into the back. I could see the left arm with the IV… I saw babies after the birth."" A gurney lies empty outside an operating room.
AP Photo/Molly Riley Sharp told the court that it ""deleted all videos taken prior to February 2013 that were irrelevant to its investigation into missing Propofol."" However, a Sharp employee responsible for handling IT issues related to the recordings testified at a deposition that he could not recall deleting any of the videos. ""There was no written protocols governing how the files would be used… [the IT employee] was treating it like the most innocuous Word document, I mean they did not take any special care with these files,"" Goddard told INSIDER. ""It's what our clients have to live with everyday knowing that these files were not treated with respect, were not treated with confidentiality, and that because of that they could have been accessed by people who should never have seen them."" Gross, the executive vice president, told the Union-Tribune that the hospital has protected the video files since it became clear that they contained sensitive information. ""We have kept this tight since 2013,"" he said. ""The current videos in our possession are kept in a secured vault within the security department at Sharp Healthcare."" Brandt's life has changed dramatically — most notably, she and her husband are now the proud parents of two daughters. ""They are extremely feisty,"" Brandt said with a laugh. ""I love watching them grow and learn. I think that's so amazing to just watch these tiny people develop personalities and learn new things every day."" She said she first learned of the secret video recordings after receiving a letter in the mail in January about the incident. ""I was totally shocked. I was shocked and I was very angry… it brought up very sad memories for me,"" Brandt told INSIDER. ""My trust has gone down significantly. Now I look back and I say I can't believe how much trust I put in that hospital."" Sharp refused to provide Goddard with the contact information of the women they recorded, citing privacy concerns, but the court allowed the hospital to provide the information to a third party who would then notify women of the situation via mail. Godard told INSIDER she is concerned that women may not have paid attention to, or fully understood, those notices. Gross told the Union-Tribune that the health system has so far notified 1,788 patients to let them know they were recorded during procedures. In the wake of the incident, Goddard said that she knows of at least one client who has avoided going to the doctor because she's lost her faith in the medical system. She added that while she knows of an incident in which a gynecologist at Johns Hopkins secretly photographed and videotaped women's bodies in the examining room with a pen-like camera he wore around his neck, she's never heard of a hospital green-lighting secret recordings in operating rooms, with the highest levels of management aware of what was going on. While both of Brandt's daughters were born at Sharp, Brandt told INSIDER that she never would have chosen that hospital had she known about the recordings. She says she feels comforted by the fact that other women have chosen to stand up, like her, and tell the world that what happened to them is not okay. ""This can never happen again. What they did significantly impacted the lives of many, many women,"" Brandt told INSIDER. ""The hospital needs to be accountable for what they've done and take responsibility.""",woman miscarried california hospital years later discovered hospital secretly taped procedure,eileen brandt

Sentry Mode, launched in January, is a security feature that turns on a Tesla's 360-degree dash camera when the driver is away and alerts them to any suspicious activity. This month, the feature helped San Francisco cops nab a would-be car thief who smashed the window of a Model 3, according to ABC7 News. Scroll down for video Tesla's Sentry Mode has only been available for car owners for a few months, but it managed to help catch a suspected thief. Dashcam video captured the burglar breaking into a Model 3 San Francisco resident Jed Franklin was away from his Model 3 when the attacker attempted to enter his vehicle. Franklin received an alert on his phone that Sentry Mode was triggered, while the vehicle captured the thief breaking into his rear passenger-side window in full view. When Sentry Mode is triggered, the dash cameras on a Tesla begin recording from multiple angles. Franklin handed this footage over to the authorities and they soon apprehended the burglar, 21-year-old Jeremiah Jefferson. Jefferson has since been charged with second-degree burglary, along with probation violation. Cameras not only caught the license plate of Jefferson's white sedan, but also a shot of his face in detail. Police later apprehended the suspect and charged him with second-degree burglary The 360-degree cameras not only caught the license plate of Jefferson's white sedan, but also a shot of his face in clear detail. Jefferson didn't make off with anything from the vehicle and the police investigation into the case is still ongoing, ABC7 reported. Police arrested 21-year-old Jeremiah Jefferson for second-degree burglary in connection with the Model 3 break-in The case follows an earlier incident that was captured by a Tesla's on-board cameras and led to an arrest. Earlier this month, Sentry Mode was able to capture a woman reportedly deliberately keying a man's Tesla, according to The Drive. The video was uploaded by YouTuber Teslatino, who said they were sent the footage by a friend who owns the car that was vandalized. In the footage, the woman can be seen keying the car door two different times. Thanks to Sentry Mode, the car owner was able to share the footage with local police and the suspect was arrested for vandalizing the vehicle. The electric car company first teased Sentry Mode earlier this year. In a series of tweets, CEO Elon Musk said 'Sentry Mode' would give users the ability to see and record any activity that happens when they step away from their Tesla. 'Sentry Mode' is available for all cars with Enhanced Autopilot, according to Musk. CEO Elon Musk said the company will roll out 'Sentry Mode' that should give users the ability to see and record any activity that happens when they step away from their Tesla  Autopilot, or Enhanced Autopilot as it was renamed to in 2016, is the software that allows Tesla vehicles to drive semi-autonomously. It enables the dashcam to remain on when the driver is away and is activated when the car senses it's been hit. Musk's post was prompted by a tweet from a Tesla owner who said his car had been hit. 'Found this monster dent this morning, right in front of the rear facing cameras,' Twitter user Andy Sutton wrote. 'Really wish there was a 360 dash cam feature while parked.' Sentry mode takes advantage of a software update, released last October for cars with Hardware 2.5 or later, which allows users to record 360-degree footage with their vehicle's front-facing camera. The footage is recorded and stored on a USB flash drive that the user has to provide. It comes as Musk has also talked about introducing 'dog mode' for the Model 3. 'Dog mode' would help canine owners when they have to step away from their vehicle. Twitter user Josh Atchley asked Musk if he could implement a 'dog mode' feature 'where the music plays and the AC is on, with a display on screen saying ""I'm fine my owner will be right back.""' It's unclear when Sentry mode will launch, but it could enable users to activate their vehicle's 360-degree front-facing camera while they've stepped away to record any possible accidents   To this, Musk simply replied: 'Yes.' By including a message on the Model 3's main screen, it would notify people that the dog or child is OK. Furthermore, another user suggested including the interior temperature on the screen as well - an idea that Musk seemed to like, replying in a tweet, 'Exactly.' As with most of Musk's ideas born on Twitter, there's no guarantee this feature will ever launch in subsequent Tesla software updates. Tesla's Model 3 is the company's first lower-cost, high-volume car. The electric sedan is crucial to Tesla's goal of becoming a profitable, mainstream automaker. The five-seat sedan will travel 215 miles (133 kilometres) on a single charge. It will be sporty, accelerating from zero to 60mph (0-100kph) in under six seconds. The Model 3 is Tesla's first lower-cost, high-volume car. The first models of the $35,000 (£27,000) electric vehicle began production in July 2017 The car has no traditional dashboard, but instead a computer monitor in the center of the car which shows details about the car and its route. It will be controlled via a touchscreen and each side of the steering wheel will have a single scroll button. The first models of the $35,000 (£27,000) electric vehicle began production in July 2017.

The charity said loyal customers are paying an average annual premium of £325 for their sixth year of insurance – nearly double that of new customers (£172). The latest research suggests that home insurance providers tend to make their profits from those customers who remain loyal for six years or more. But the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said that whether or not a firm makes a profit depends on “many factors” and companies have committed to review premiums charged to customers who have been with them for more than five years. Those sticking with their providers year in, year out could find themselves paying hundreds of pounds more for their policies than those who switch every year, Citizens Advice found. It said after six years, a loyal customer could typically expect to have paid a total of £1,596 – £500 more than someone who spends every year as a new customer with their insurer, paying £1,032 on average. Citizens Advice looked at the typical costs of home insurance, contents insurance, and combined home and contents policies. It said it had used figures from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the ABI. The charity said that in 2016 there were 9.3 million policies across the UK where customers had been loyal to their provider for six years or more and 6.9 million policies where customers switched after a year. Citizens Advice said it is particularly concerned that vulnerable people, including those in poor health, may be particularly likely to end up paying the loyalty penalty. It estimates that 3.75 million policies have been held for 11 years or more and in seven in 10 of these, customers are potentially vulnerable. In one case, a 76-year-old pensioner with severe arthritis, who had been with the same provider for over 10 years, received a renewal letter wanting to increase her premium from £1,500 to £3,500 a year. She said: “I was shocked, really confused and also sad that they expected me to pay so much. “I had no choice but to find a cheaper provider. As I don’t have access to the internet I went through the Yellow Pages and called quite a few insurance providers and found a far cheaper deal of £958 per year.” Citizens Advice submitted a “super-complaint” on the loyalty penalty, in the mobile, broadband, home insurance, mortgages and savings markets, to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which made recommendations after finding “damaging practices” by firms including stealth price rises. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “What makes this worse is that vulnerable people are likely to be the most loyal to their provider. “Since we submitted our super-complaint about the loyalty penalty, some companies have rightly promised to treat their customers better, yet many more are still choosing to make their profits off their most loyal and vulnerable consumers.” Hugh Savill, director of regulation at the ABI, said: “Whether a firm makes a profit or not depends on many factors which these figures overlook. “However, the insurance industry has already acknowledged that fierce competition between insurers for new business can result in long-standing customers losing out.",home insurance customers paying hundreds pounds loyalty penalty study finds,loyal home insurance customers stick provider six years driving profits sector analysis citizens advice suggests charity said loyal customers paying average annual premium sixth year insurance nearly double new customers latest research suggests home insurance providers tend make profits customers remain loyal six years association british insurers abi said whether firm makes profit depends many factors companies committed review premiums charged customers five years sticking providers year year could find paying hundreds pounds policies switch every year citizens advice found said six years loyal customer could typically expect paid total someone spends every year new customer insurer paying average citizens advice looked typical costs home insurance contents insurance combined home contents policies said used figures financial conduct authority fca abi charity said million policies across uk customers loyal provider six years million policies customers switched year citizens advice said particularly concerned vulnerable people including poor health may particularly likely end paying loyalty penalty estimates million policies held years seven customers potentially vulnerable one case pensioner severe arthritis provider years received renewal letter wanting increase premium year said shocked really confused also sad expected pay much choice find cheaper provider access internet went yellow pages called quite insurance providers found far cheaper deal per citizens advice submitted loyalty penalty mobile broadband home insurance mortgages savings markets competition markets authority cma made recommendations finding damaging practices firms including stealth price rises gillian guy chief executive citizens advice said makes worse vulnerable people likely loyal provider since submitted loyalty penalty companies rightly promised treat customers better yet many still choosing make profits loyal vulnerable hugh savill director regulation abi said whether firm makes profit depends many factors figures overlook however insurance industry already acknowledged fierce competition insurers new business result customers losing

It is the first such demand for a sitting president’s tax information in 45 years. Scientists are expected Wednesday to unveil humanity's first-ever photo of a black hole, according to the National Science Foundation. Specifically, the photo will be of ""Sagittarius A,"" the supermassive black hole — that is, collapsed star — at the center of our Milky Way galaxy. The image may even help prove or cast doubt upon Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity. Technically, we're likely to see only the edge of the black hole at the 9 a.m. ET news conference, since not even light can escape its massive gravitational pull. A wild storm that's expected to bring snow, drenching rains and flooding to 200 million Americans through Thursday will continue to cause mayhem in the western and central U.S. Parts of the northern Plains and Upper Midwest could see a total of two feet of snow, with wind gusts of up to 70 mph thrown into the wintry mix. Blizzard warnings have been posted in parts of Nebraska, South Dakota and Minnesota. The National Weather Service warned of power outages and ""life-threatening travel conditions."" Be safe.

Launch is set for 6:36 p.m. ET. After liftoff, Falcon heavy's two side boosters will attempt automated landings at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, while the center core will shoot for a drone ship. Falcon Heavy debuted in January 2018 in a demonstration flight that carried SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk's Roadster sports car into orbit.

Actually he said this: “After four years we have met or are about to meet the vast majority of our turnaround goals. I'm very confident that we will complete the journey in 2019/20.” You get my drift, though. Hooray, said he City of London, and no wonder. The key numbers are nearly all heading in the right direction. Pre tax profits were up 28 per cent, the dividend almost doubled. Expectations were high in the run up, but Lewis beat them all the same. It is worth noting that UK sales growth slipped in the second half of the year, and the overseas businesses continue to struggle. Quibbles? Yes but important ones. Nonetheless, the state of the business when Lewis took over shouldn't be forgotten. The grocer was reeling from the scandal of a £250m black hole in its accounts and looked clueless, not just in the face of the challenge posed by Aldi and Lidl but even that of Sainsbury’s for goodness sake. About the only innovation of note under Clarke’s regime was the Hudl, a now discontinued Tesco tablet. With Lewis having cut his teeth at Unilever, a supplier rather than a retailer, questions were raised about whether he was the right man to turn the ship around. The doubters have fallen silent. This is a retailer that knows what it’s about again. So do its customers. It’s delivering what they want, mostly, and looks better placed to cope with the Conservative government’s attempts to rip the country apart than some of its rivals even if Lewis' cost cutting plans, and the closure of fresh food counters, aren't to everyone's taste. He's even having a go at discounting, moving his tanks on to the lawn of the German pair with the ‘Jack’s’ format. Lewis says the response to it has been good. But I doubt Aldi and Liddl's bosses are overly worried. The nationalistic branding and 1950s chic suggest the format could handle a tweak. Still, no one’s going to crucify diamond Dave for playing with ideas now he’s got the core business firing on all cylinders. He’s earned that right and he’s earned the right to pat himself on the back and to receive one from the City. Tesco has always employed some of Britain’s best retailers. They just needed pointing in the right direction, which Lewis has done. Nor is he standing still as Tesco moves into its next phase under his stewardship.",tesco roars city wary lionising ceo lewis,job done said tesco boss dave lewis unveiled bravura set results actually said four years met meet vast majority turnaround goals confident complete journey get drift though hooray said city london wonder key numbers nearly heading right direction pre tax profits per cent dividend almost doubled expectations high run lewis beat worth noting uk sales growth slipped second half year overseas businesses continue struggle quibbles yes important ones nonetheless state business lewis took forgotten grocer reeling scandal black hole accounts looked clueless face challenge posed aldi lidl even sainsbury goodness sake innovation note clarke regime hudl discontinued tesco tablet lewis cut teeth unilever supplier rather retailer questions raised whether right man turn ship around doubters fallen silent retailer knows customers delivering want mostly looks better placed cope conservative government attempts rip country apart rivals even lewis cost cutting plans closure fresh food counters everyone taste even go discounting moving tanks lawn german pair jack format lewis says response good doubt aldi liddl bosses overly worried nationalistic branding chic suggest format could handle tweak still one going crucify diamond dave playing ideas got core business firing cylinders earned right earned right pat back receive one city tesco always employed britain best retailers needed pointing right direction lewis done standing still tesco moves next phase stewardship

The electric vehicle's Sentry Mode sent a notification to owner Jed Franklin via the Tesla smartphone app after one of the back windows was broken into while the car was parked in San Francisco. Cameras positioned on the Tesla Model 3 allowed Mr Franklin to record the suspect, both during the incident and in the moments leading up to it. This video was then shared with San Francisco Police, who used it to apprehend the suspect. According to Tesla's website, Sentry Mode is designed to protect against break-ins and theft by offering a ""unique layer of protection"" to Model 3, Model S and Model X vehicles built after August 2017. It works by continuous monitoring the environment around the car when its left unattended by using the vehicle's vast array of cameras and sensors that are usually used to facilitate semi-autonomous driving. ""While no alarm system can prevent against all vehicle thefts, break-ins and threats, we hope that with Sentry Mode and our other security features, your Tesla will be even more secure,"" the Tesla site states.",tesla sentry mode helps apprehend thief,police apprehended car thief tesla attempting steal alerted owner suspicious activity electric vehicle sentry mode sent notification owner jed franklin via tesla smartphone app one back windows broken car parked san francisco cameras positioned tesla model allowed mr franklin record suspect incident moments leading video shared san francisco police used apprehend suspect according tesla website sentry mode designed protect theft offering unique layer protection model model model x vehicles built august works continuous monitoring environment around car left unattended using vehicle vast array cameras sensors usually used facilitate driving alarm system prevent vehicle thefts threats hope sentry mode security features tesla even secure tesla site states

The worst secretary of state in British political history has been forced to further delay the award of the South Eastern franchise, while at the same time blocking Stagecoach from bidding for three of them in the wake of a fierce row over pensions. Stagecoach runs rail services singly and through its near 50 per cent stake in Virgin Trains, but the decision by Grayling’s Department for Transport has raised questions over whether it will be in the business for very much longer. At issue is the funding shortfall in the Railways Pension Scheme. The Pensions Regulator thinks that up to £6bn may be needed to plug it. The government wants the rail companies to pony up, and there’s a certain logic to its position. If you’re running a privatised industry you should take on the risks inherent in doing so. The rail companies, whose model has long been based on having their cake and eating it, disagree. There is a certain logic to their position too. They point out that they can’t possibly hope to manage long term financial risks over which they have no control while running (relatively) short term franchises. The debate is both complex and technical, as they often are when it comes to pensions, and none of those involved in it are entirely in the right, including the regulator. It’s much less important than the fact that it once again brutally exposes the flaws inherent in the rail franchising system, a dead horse that successive governments have been flogging for far too long. There are two ways you can attack that issue, which is currently the subject of an independent review being led by Keith Williams. You can institute reforms that keep privatisation more or less intact and hope the system works better under them. This what people like Stagecoach boss Martin Griffiths would like to see happen. Alternatively, you could simply accept that privatising the real industry was a mistake that has failed passengers, workers and taxpayers, and scrap it. There are wise old sages who would at this point seek to remind us that British Rail didn't exactly deliver an efficient and well run service when it was in charge. But it’s also worth remembering what happened when the East Coast Mainline found itself back in government hands.",stagecoach shunted rail franchising siding row pensions exposes flaws privatisation,rail operator stagecoach shunted siding amid emergence another calamity transport secretary chris failing grayling courtesy latest round rail franchising worst secretary state british political history forced delay award south eastern franchise time blocking stagecoach bidding three wake fierce row pensions stagecoach runs rail services singly near per cent stake virgin trains decision grayling department transport raised questions whether business much longer issue funding shortfall railways pension scheme pensions regulator thinks may needed plug government wants rail companies pony certain logic position running privatised industry take risks inherent rail companies whose model long based cake eating disagree certain logic position point possibly hope manage long term financial risks control running relatively short term franchises debate complex technical often comes pensions none involved entirely right including regulator much less important fact brutally exposes flaws inherent rail franchising system dead horse successive governments flogging far long two ways attack issue currently subject independent review led keith williams institute reforms keep privatisation less intact hope system works better people like stagecoach boss martin griffiths would like see happen alternatively could simply accept privatising real industry mistake failed passengers workers taxpayers scrap wise old sages would point seek remind us british rail exactly deliver efficient well run service charge also worth remembering happened east coast mainline found back government hands

The existing $7,500 tax credit for buyers of EVs phases out over 15 months once an automaker sells 200,000 electric cars. The tax credit for Tesla buyers was halved to $3,750 on Jan. 1; General Motor's tax credit was likewise cut in half starting April 1. The bill, dubbed the Driving America Forward Act, would grant each automaker a $7,000 tax credit for an additional 400,000 vehicles after it exhausts the first 200,000 vehicles eligible for tax credits. It would shorten the phase-out schedule to nine months. The credits are paid directly to consumers, who can write them off on their tax returns. ""At a time when climate change is having a real effect on Michigan, today's legislation is something we can do now to reduce emissions and combat carbon pollution,"" Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., one of the sponsors of the legislation, said in a statement. ""Our bill will help create American jobs and cement Michigan's status as an advanced manufacturing hub."" Tesla shares rose 1.6 percent in morning trading Wednesday on the news. Sens. Gary Peters, D-Mich., Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich., signed on to the bill. Electric vehicles comprise a tiny, but growing, share of the U.S. vehicle market. Support for low- and no-emissions vehicles has grown both in the U.S. and in other major automotive markets, such as China. Though Tesla has been a market leader in EVs, several automakers are planning to release fully electric cars, trucks and SUVs over the next few years. ""This would be a major shot in the arm for Tesla as this could be a much needed potential catalyst for demand in the U.S."" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. ""Ultimately, while there are still hurdles to get this legislation passed, it would result in an additional 40,000 Tesla vehicles sold domestically in 2019 based on our estimates.

Some analysts, like Morgan Stanley's widely followed Adam Jona s, lump Elon Musk's electric car company with other traditional automakers, while others like Gene Munster is well known for his comparison to Apple. Nomura Instinet, which re-instated coverage of Tesla on Tuesday, has another idea: Salesforce. ""Similar to some of the Software greats' disruption of enterprise hardware, TSLA is a true disruptor of the automotive industry, in our view,"" analyst Chris Eberle said in a note to clients ""It forces legacy combustion engine behemoths to scramble to develop competing products without cannibalizing their cash flow machines—keeping them comfortably at a distinct disadvantage, similar to what Salesforce (CRM) did when it pioneered the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business model."" Eberle has reinstated coverage of Tesla after the firm's previous analyst, Romit Shah, dropped the company in February, according to Bloomberg data. His initiation comes at a $300 price target, about 7% higher than shares were set to open Wednesday. According to Eberle, Tesla's over-the-air software updates are akin to Salesforce's move to put CRM (customer relationship management) software on the cloud in the early 2000's. ""We liken this to TSLA's over-the-air software vehicle updates, which alongside fewer moving and mechanical parts, essentially eliminates 80% of ""maintenance"" that historically required an auto mechanic (and, in CRM's case, software engineer), "" Eberle said. Like most Wall Street bulls, Eberle points to Tesla's massive market opportunity in taking share from other automakers. ""For much of Tesla's existence, established automakers did not even consider the company as competition,"" Eberle said. ""Even following the dramatic success of the Model S in the first half of the decade, Tesla was considered not much more than a novelty: a niche luxury automaker, primarily serving the upper end of the U.S. market. Over the past 24 months, however, that has all changed."" Noura And he's not worried — like many other analysts— about the latest slowdown in demand for Tesla vehicles. ""We continue to believe in the depth of worldwide demand, particularly considering the size of the regional markets in Europe (double the U.S. market) and China (becoming many multiples of U.S.),"" Eberle said. ""Furthermore, we see the introduction of Model 3 leasing as a potentially big demand lever, and we believe that a mass-market SUV/CUV offering in the Model Y (unveiled March 14 2019, with mass production expected by end-2020), could double Tesla's total market opportunity.""",latest wall street analyst launch coverage tesla says investors compare unlikely tech giant tsla,wall street always struggled compare tesla baskets stocks analysts like morgan stanley widely followed adam jona lump elon musk electric car company traditional automakers others like gene munster well known comparison apple nomura instinet coverage tesla tuesday another idea salesforce similar software greats disruption enterprise hardware tsla true disruptor automotive industry view analyst chris eberle said note clients forces legacy combustion engine behemoths scramble develop competing products without cannibalizing cash flow comfortably distinct disadvantage similar salesforce crm pioneered saas business model eberle reinstated coverage tesla firm previous analyst romit shah dropped company february according bloomberg data initiation comes price target higher shares set open wednesday according eberle tesla software updates akin salesforce move put crm customer relationship management software cloud early liken tsla software vehicle updates alongside fewer moving mechanical parts essentially eliminates maintenance historically required auto mechanic crm case software engineer eberle said like wall street bulls eberle points tesla massive market opportunity taking share automakers much tesla existence established automakers even consider company competition eberle said even following dramatic success model first half decade tesla considered much novelty niche luxury automaker primarily serving upper end market past months however changed noura worried like many latest slowdown demand tesla vehicles continue believe depth worldwide demand particularly considering size regional markets europe double market china becoming many multiples eberle said furthermore see introduction model leasing potentially big demand lever believe offering model unveiled march mass production expected could double tesla total market opportunity

About six hours later, the Falcon Heavy rocket's upper stage fired for a final time, sending Starman into an orbit around the Sun, with an aphelion just beyond the orbit of Mars. Since then I, and others, have wondered what the long-term fate of Starman will be. At first, not much was known about the Tesla's location. The first inkling of its orbital parameters came from an image that Musk tweeted. (Later, this turned out to be inaccurate). The first verified and publicly available location data came from the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC), the US Air Force command tasked with tracking objects in space. But this only covered the time it was in Earth orbit, not Starman's position after the final upper-stage burn. Using those two pieces of information, on February 7, I created a website that allowed a person to see how far away the Tesla was from Earth. But this data was quite limited at first. Further Reading
This may be the moment SpaceX opened the cosmos to the masses
The next bit of information came from JPL Horizons, a tool produced by JPL’s Solar System Dynamics organization that is tasked with tracking objects in the Solar System. On February 8, it used data provided directly from SpaceX to allow one with proper knowledge to query the system and determine exactly where Starman was at any given time. This provided useful information for a few months, but beyond that time period, the data simply could not provide enough information. Over the ensuing months, JPL received tracking data provided by optical telescopes that allowed it to refine the trajectory for Starman. Some people even used this early information to predict Starman’s long-term future; however, the data had a very short arc and was only really reliable for a few years at best. The best-known effort predicted that Starman would pass close to Earth in 2091 and resulted in a paper entitled “The Random Walk of Cars and Their Collision Probabilities with Planets."" But that initial 2091 prediction was inaccurate because the tracking information relied on only a week’s worth of observational data. JPL Horizons produced its final solution at the end of March 2019. This came after the last known telescope to observe Starman, a one-meter instrument at Las Cumbres Observatory near Sutherland, South Africa, did so on March 19, 2019. After that time, all future predictions had to be based on just seven weeks of high-quality data. These predictions are made by taking the position in the sky of the observations and using that to fit a model of the orbital path around the Sun. With seven weeks of data, we can get a pretty good estimate of that path, and the current predictions have a calculated uncertainty of only a few kilometers. There are some consistent errors that show up when calculating such data, the most common being steady non-gravitational acceleration. This can be caused by the small, steady pressure of sunlight, differences in the temperature of different sides of the vehicle, and out-gassing. (Outgassing is an effect of sunlight boiling some of the non-metallic parts of the vehicle, which will cause a small pressure difference over time.) The measurements that have been made of Starman show that it is being pushed slightly away from the Sun. The data should be very accurate for about 50 years, but as it has close passes with planets, particularly Earth, that uncertainty will grow considerably. After 100 years it will be much less reliable. What we can say for now The next time Starman will pass close to a planet will be to Mars on October 7, 2020. This will not be a particularly close pass; it will be about 4.6 million miles (7.4 million km) away from Mars. At that distance, Mars will appear only as a tiny dot, as seen in this simulation. This will not be enough to significantly alter the orbit of the Tesla.
Simulated view of Starman on October 7, 2020.
Ben Pearson/ Where is Roadster 3D simulator There are many instruments at Mars—could any of them see Starman in 2020? The biggest telescope near Mars is the HiRISE instrument, which has occasionally imaged bright stars, and even Jupiter. However, it is not configured as an astronomical telescope and, due to its design, can only see bright objects, so it would not work to image Starman, which is predicted to be a magnitude 22 object as seen from Mars in 2020. A much closer pass will happen at Mars on April 22, 2035. The distance this time will only be about 1.4 million miles (2.3 million km), and has a small chance of being much closer. The predicted error is higher the further in time one goes, but at this point things are still accurate enough to be very confident it will be that close to Mars within three hours of the prediction. It is theoretically possible that a telescope could be placed on Mars by 2035 that will be able to observe Starman. A one-meter telescope, such as the South African telescope that last observed Starman, could easily do it. With so many new super-heavy rockets being planned, one of them could possibly carry such a payload to Mars by then. (It is worth noting that, in order to resolve more than a dot, Starman would have to make a pass within 37,000 miles (60,000km) of a telescope 10m (33 feet) in diameter. This is the size of the largest telescopes on Earth, so unless Starship starts flying by Starman as part of a Solar System cruise, we may never resolve the Tesla or Starman again.) How about the next Earth flyby? Close approaches to Earth are predicted to happen about every 30 to 35 years, often in pairs. The first of these close passes will occur on January 11, 2047. The distance is predicted to be about 3 million miles (4.8 million km), which is close enough that it can certainly be seen from Earth, about four times closer than the last reported observation of Starman from South Africa. These new observations should allow us enough data to better predict its journey throughout the Solar System for many hundreds of years to come. Starman will also make a second, slightly more distant pass in 2050.
Simulated view of Starman on January 11, 2047.
Ben Pearson/ Where is Roadster 3D simulator After this point in time, measurements become much less certain. A very small error becomes a much larger one over so many years, and small errors are magnified by a huge margin when passing close to a body such as Earth. Furthermore, predictions are complicated by non-gravitational forces such as sunlight; we do not know how Starman is oriented, which will greatly influence this force. From 2050 to 2085, we know that Starman will be in the region between Earth and Mars, making a few distant flybys of Mars, but none particularly close, likely no closer than it will be in 2020. The next time it will be close to Earth is around January 1, 2085, but the predictions are much less certain that far out—it could be off by as many as four days in either direction. A second close approach will happen around March 9, 2088. Beyond this point we just don’t have much data, but the current predictions are for close approaches in 2119 and 2123 to Earth. Beyond this point in time, it is extremely difficult to know if a close approach will even happen at that time. During this entire period of time Starman is predicted to remain in roughly the same orbit, although there is a significant chance its orbit might start to reach out farther, maybe even reach the Asteroid Belt as Elon Musk initially stated. Beyond simply tracking cars roaming through deep space, this kind of analysis can be helpful in other ways. Tracking asteroids and comets is extremely important; if one were to hit the Earth it could cause tremendous amounts of damage. Using the same tools that were used to make these predictions, scientists and engineers can predict the path of near-Earth objects that might someday hit our planet. These objects, like Starman, cannot be seen continually, and thus we must predict their paths with limited data—sometimes for many years into the future.",starman probably see,little year ago spacex

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten is odds-on favourite to be Australia's next prime minister, despite the government campaigning strongly against his renewable energy and negative gearing policies to help younger people afford a home. Betting agency Sportsbet is predicting the biggest federal Labor majority in 76 years, in an election where four Liberal ministers would lose their seat. More than 16.2million voters are heading to the polls in five weeks in an election which could see a government voted out of office for only the eighth time since World War II. Prime Minister Scott Morrison arrived at Government House in Canberra on Thursday morning to speak to Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove about dissolving Parliament. Australians face the starkest policy choice in a generation with an election to be held in just five weeks (pictured are Bill Shorten with wife Chloe and Scott Morrison with wife Jenny) Mr Morrison arrived at Government House in Canberra on Thursday morning to speak to Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove about dissolving Parliament Mr Morrison arrived at Government House in Canberra on Thursday morning Mr Shorten told Daily Mail Australia last month his policy agenda was the most ambitious since Gough Whitlam won the 1972 election by campaigning on the theme, 'It's Time.' His Labor Party is vowing to have Australia source 50 per cent of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. Labor also wants half of all vehicles sold in Australia within 11 years to be electric or hybrid cars, a very dramatic increase from the 0.2 per cent market share they have now. The Opposition also wants to slash carbon emissions by 45 per cent by 2030.

The Opposition is also vowing to scrap negative gearing tax breaks for future purchases of existing property, so fewer investors are competing with younger Australians wanting to buy their first home.

Margins are based on electoral redistributions since the 2016 election, as analysed by Malcolm Mackerras  Labor has promised to stop wealthy retirees, who don't pay income tax, from getting tax refunds for when they receive share dividends. The Opposition says its winding back of negative gearing and its tax crackdowns on shareholders will save $80billion over the next decade. The government, which lacks a parliamentary majority, is opposed to both of these policies and has been campaigning fiercely for the Baby Boomer vote. Mr Morrison, who became PM in August, will call a May election, a week after his Treasurer Josh Frydenberg delivered a Budget giving annual tax cuts of up to $1,080 for 10 million Australian workers earning up to $126,000 a year. Mr Shorten has vowed to match the tax cuts and give even more to lower income earners on less than $40,000 a year, who were promised $255 a year in the Budget. His Budget-reply speech also offered a $2.3 billion policy whereby the Commonwealth would pay the medical bills of cancer sufferers - five years after the Opposition Leader's mother Ann died of breast cancer. The Liberal-National party Coalition last week unveiled the first Budget surplus in 12 years - something a federal Labor government hasn't delivered since 1989 when Bob Hawke was prime minister. The government, however, is plagued with disunity, having disposed Tony Abbott in September 2015 before right-wing forces brought down his prime ministerial successor Malcolm Turnbull in August 2018. Both major parties are committed to sending asylum seekers to offshore processing centres at Nauru and Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Labor, however, is open about them being allowed to move to New Zealand, following an offer from Kiwi Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. When Labor was last in government former prime minister Kevin Rudd in 2008 dismantled the Pacific solution. This led to a surge in boat arrivals, rising from just three in the 2007-08 financial year, to 117 in 2009-10. Or put another way, the number of asylum seekers surged from 25 to 5,327, figures from a Parliament House research paper showed. Labor also wants half of all vehicles sold in Australia within 11 years to be electric cars (Tesla Model X pictured), a very dramatic increase from the 0.2 per cent market share they have now, as part of a plan for 50 per cent of Australia's energy to come from renewables by 2030 The policy change also coincided with the deaths of 48 people, mainly asylum seekers from Iran and Iraq, as their boat sunk and washed on to cliffs at Christmas Island in December 2010. Warringah, NSW, Liberal: Winter Olympic champion Zali Steggall has an even money chance of defeating former PM Tony Abbott, whose odds are marginally shorter than his opponent campaigning on the issue of climate change Cowper, NSW, Nationals: former independent Rob Oakeshott is the short-priced favourite to win this Mid-North Coast electorate. He backed a Labor minority government in 2010  The Coalition has now lost 50 Newspolls in a row to Labor, trailing the Opposition 46 to 54 per cent after preferences. If replicated at the election, the government would suffer a 4.4 per cent swing against it causing the Liberal and National parties to lose 12 seats. Betting agency Sportsbet, however, has Labor picking up 23 seats from the Coalition, which would see its seat numbers swell to 93 in the expanded 151-member House of Representatives. The Liberal and National parties would see their seat tally plummet from 75 now to 53, marking the worst electoral drubbing for the conservative side of politics since 1943. This would give Mr Shorten the biggest federal election majority since March 1996, when John Howard's Liberal-National Coalition defeated Paul Keating's Labor Party in a landslide. It would also mark the biggest Labor majority since John Curtin was prime minister during World War II. Both major parties are committed to sending asylum seekers to offshore processing centres at Nauru and Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. But when Labor was last in government, boat arrivals surged after it abolished the Pacific solution (asylum seeker boat at Christmas Island pictured) Mr Shorten is on course to be the first prime minister since 1914 to have won an election after taking over as Opposition Leader from the time his party was defeated at the polls. Sportsbet predicted ministers Peter Dutton, Christian Porter, David Coleman and Ken Wyatt would lose their seats. Wentworth, NSW, Independent: 1.2 per cent Indi, Victoria, Independent: 4.8 per cent The betting agency is predicting the Liberal Party will lose to Labor the seat of Boothby, in Adelaide's southern suburbs, which it has held since 1949. It also had former independent Rob Oakeshott as the short-priced favourite to pick up Cowper, on the New South Wales Mid-North Coast, from the Nationals, where former minister Luke Hartsuyker is retiring. But the betting market had the Liberal Party winning back former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull's old seat of Wentworth, in Sydney's eastern suburbs, as another former PM Tony Abbott narrowly held on to his nearby electorate of Warringah. Veteran election analyst Malcolm Mackerras was less optimistic about Mr Shorten's chances of a Labor landslide, predicting it will win 83 seats, up from the 69 it won in 2016, and factoring in an electoral redistribution in two Liberal-held seats in Victoria. 'I think he's performing very well,' he told Daily Mail Australia. The Coalition, under his scenario, would see its seat tally drop from 75 to 64, as the Liberal Party regained the northern Victorian electorate of Indi, where independent Cathy McGowan is retiring. Mr Morrison, who became PM in August, will call a May 18 election, days after his Treasurer Josh Frydenberg (pictured with son Blake) delivered a Budget giving tax cuts of up to $1,080 for 10 million Australian workers earning up to $126,000 a year Mr Turnbull's old seat of Wentworth could also be another Liberal gain, as Dave Sharma defeated independent Dr Kerryn Phelps, who won an October by-election and pushed the government into minority territory. Mr Turnbull's arch nemesis Mr Abbott was tipped to lose his Sydney northern beaches electorate of Warringah to winter Olympian Zali Steggall, with Sportsbet and opinion polls showing a close contest. 'I think Sharma has a slightly better chance of winning Wentworth than Abbott has of retaining Warringah,' Mr Mackerras said. 'Dave Sharma is thought to be a  very good candidate who belongs to basically the moderate side of the party. Mr Turnbull's arch nemesis Tony Abbott (left) was tipped to lose his Sydney northern beaches electorate of Warringah to winter Olympian Zali Steggall (right) 'More particularly, people put Kerryn Phelps in to express their anger about the Liberal Party sacking Turnbull. Now that anger's over, they'll say, 'Well, Sharma's a good candidate'.' Mr Mackerras saw Attorney-General Christian Porter losing his Perth-based seat of Pearce, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton losing his Brisbane electorate of Dickson and Aged Care Minister Ken Wyatt losing his eastern Perth electorate of Hasluck. Mr Mackerras, an honorary fellow with the Australian Catholic University, however, predicted Immigration Minister David Coleman would hold his marginal south-west Sydney seat of Banks, despite its narrow 1.4 per cent margin. It overlaps with the state seats of East Hills and Oatley, which recorded swings to the Liberal Party at the March state election. Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton (pictured) is tipped to lose his Brisbane seat of Dickson while Attorney-General Christian Porter is regarded as being in danger in his Perth seat of Pearce Mr Mackerras said while Mr Morrison wasn't particularly popular across Australia, his Liberal Party had stronger support in that part of Sydney, which for six decades had supported Labor at a state and federal level. 'I think in southern Sydney, he's doing very well which is part of the reason why I think Banks will stay with the Liberal Party,' he said. 'Apart from that, I just don't think people think much of him. 'He doesn't come across to me as being at all competent. 'He certainly doesn't come across as deserving to be Prime Minister.' Dawson, in north Queensland, would also stay with the Nationals , with renegade backbencher George Christensen (right with maverick independent Bob Katter) campaigning for the government to fund a coal-fired power station He also predicted the Nationals would keep their most marginal seat of Capricornia, in central Queensland, despite assistant minister Michelle Landry holding it by a very slim 0.6 per cent margin. Dawson, in north Queensland, would also stay with the Nationals , with renegade backbencher George Christensen campaigning for the government to fund a coal-fired power station. 'Areas that are near to possible new coal mines stay will stay with the Nationals,' Mr Mackerras said. 'They're close enough to the Bowen Basin developments.' Even before the election begins, electorate distributions in the Liberal-held Victorian seats of Corangamite and Dunkley already favour Labor, which means sitting government members Sarah Henderson and Chris Crewther will need to increase their vote to keep their jobs. Betting agency Sportsbet has Labor picking up 23 new seats from the Coalition. This would see Labor end up with 93 seats out of 151, giving it 61.6 per cent of seats in an expanded House of Representatives. This would be Labor's biggest majority haul of seats, in percentage terms, since 1943 when John Curtin was wartime prime minister. This would also be a bigger win than Bob Hawke's 1983 victory and Kevin Rudd's 2007 defeat of John Howard. It would mark the biggest landslide since 1996, when John Howard's Liberal-National Coalition defeated Paul Keating's Labor Party, which had been in power for 13 years. The Coalition's seat tally would plummet from 75 now to 53, marking its worst defeat  in 76 years, before the Liberal Party was founded. Were the betting predictions to materialise, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton would lose his Brisbane seat of Dickson while Attorney-General Christian Porter would be defeated in his Perth seat of Pearce. Aged Care Minister Ken Wyatt, the first indigenous member of the House of Representatives, would also lose his eastern Perth seat of Hasluck while Immigration Minister David Coleman would lose his south-west Sydney seat of Banks. Former prime minister Tony Abbott is also in danger in his Sydney northern beaches seat of Warringah, against independent challenger and Winter Olympic champion Zali Steggall, although he is narrowly favoured to stay in Parliament. Former independent Rob Oakeshott is the favourite to claim the New South Wales Mid-North Coast seat of Cowper from the Nationals, where former minister Luke Hartsuyker is retiring. The Liberal Party could regain the northern Victorian seat of Indi, following the retirement of independent Cathy McGowan. Dave Sharma also has short odds of regaining former PM Malcolm Turnbull's seat of Wentworth, in Sydney's eastern suburbs, which former Australian Medical Association president Dr Kerryn Phelps won as an independent in an October 2018 by-election. Were Sportsbet's scenarios to materialise, Mr Oakeshott would be one of five crossbenchers in the lower house, along with Greens MP Adam Bandt, Centre Alliance's Rebekha Sharkie, maverick Bob Katter and independent Andrew Wilkie.

Since last summer, cloud vendors Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, and IBM have been competing for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure contract, which a winner-take-all contract that aims to move sensitive military data to one — and only one — cloud platform. ""After evaluating all of the proposals received, the Department of Defense has made a competitive range determination for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud request for proposals, in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations,"" said Department of Defense spokeswoman Elissa Smith. ""The two companies within the competitive range will participate further in the procurement process."" Read: As bidding closes, Amazon's cloud is the favorite to win a $10 billion defense deal. Here's why everybody else is so mad about it Microsoft and Amazon are able to move forward because they fulfilled the minimum requirements needed for the project. The spokesperson also confirmed that this means the other companies that were bidding in the contract will not be moving forward in the process — namely, Oracle and IBM. Smith says that the contract is expected to be awarded by mid-July at the earliest. This process was delayed following a conflict of interest lawsuit filed by Oracle against Amazon over the JEDI deal. An investigation on the procurement process concluded that there was ""no adverse impact on the integrity of the acquisition process,"" but a separate investigation has been opened into potential ethical violations, Smith said. Now that the first investigation has been completed, the Department of Defense will ask the court to lift the stay so the process can resume, Smith said. ""This portion of the investigation determined that there are no conflicts of interest that affected the integrity of the acquisition process,"" Smith said. ""However, there may be potential ethical violations, which have been referred to [Department of Defense Inspector General] for further investigation."" Previously, IBM and Oracle filed official protests against JEDI's winner-take-all approach in court. In October, Google dropped out of the bid for JEDI. Read: There's a new snag for Amazon in the winner-take-all $10 billion Pentagon cloud contract, and it could be good news for Microsoft The Department of Defense plans to use multiple clouds for its overall cloud strategy, Smith said. The winner-take-all JEDI is just one element of its future cloud plans, and there will be further opportunity for other vendors to step in. ""DOD remains committed to adopting the best enterprise cloud solution that fits its unique and critical needs,"" Smith said. ""The scope and complexity of DOD's mission requires multiple clouds from multiple vendors. JEDI is one element of DOD's overall multi-cloud strategy and part of larger efforts to modernize information technology across the DOD enterprise.""

The airline confirmed the news Wednesday afternoon after days speculation. The boutique US carrier is expected to launch service to London from its bases in Boston and New York. ""Twenty years ago, our founders had a simple formula for choosing a new market — it had to be overpriced, underserved, or both,"" Joanna Geraghty, JetBlue's president and COO, said in a statement. ""The fares being charged today by airlines on these routes, specifically on the premium end, are enough to make you blush."" According to Geraghty, London is the largest metropolitan area not served by JetBlue from New York and Boston. Read more:The 15 most popular flights in the world. The airline has not yet selected which of London's airports it will serve. However, travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt told Business Insider he expects JetBlue to select either Gatwick or Heathrow. According to Harteveldt, Gatwick is the most likely destination for the JetBlue due to the extraordinarily high costs required to obtain landing rights at Heathrow.

The firm was keeping an eye on strong upper-level winds ahead of the planned launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday evening. Ultimately, however, SpaceX decided to scrub the launch and is now hoping to take off on Thursday instead. The backup launch window will open up tomorrow at 6:35 p.m, and remain open until 8:31 p.m. It’s been fourteen months since its maiden launch, when it blasted off to become the most powerful rocket in use today, and Falcon Heavy is now gearing up for round two – this time to launch its first commercial mission. SpaceX completed a static fire of the massive rocket last week ahead of lift-off. Falcon Heavy will be carrying Lockheed Martin’s Arabsat 6A communications satellite to orbit when it finally blasts off. Scroll down for video SpaceX has pushed back the Falcon Heavy's second flight yet again due to uncooperative weather. The firm was keeping an eye on strong upper-level winds ahead of the planned launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday evening. Falcon Heavy can be seen on the launchpad ahead of take-off Height: 70 meters (229.6 feet) Stages: Two Boosters: Two Re-usable Cores: Three Engines: 27 Payload to LEO: 63,800kg (140,660 lb) Payload to Mars: 16,800kg (37,040 lb) Total width: 12.2m (39.9 ft) Mass: 1,420,788kg (3,125,735 lb) Total thrust at lift-off: 22,819 kilonewtons (5.13 million pounds) This launch will be the first time Falcon Heavy flies using the new Block 5 hardware, which is designed to last longer than previous versions without the need for refurbishment. Because of this, CEO Elon Musk says they’re being ‘extra cautious,’ and previously noted that the schedule could shift. After its first launch last February, SpaceX managed to successfully land the two side boosters back on Earth in a remarkable, synchronized feat. The center core, however, missed its mark and crashed into the ocean. For its second launch, SpaceX says it will attempt to recover all three boosters. 'SpaceX will attempt to land Falcon Heavy’s side boosters at Landing Zones 1 and 2 and Falcon Heavy’s center core on the Of Course I Still Love You droneship during the Arabsat-6A mission,' the firm tweeted ahead of launch. Falcon Heavy will be even more powerful this time around, with a maximum thrust of 2,550 tons, according to Musk – or about 10 percent higher than last year’s demo.  The Kennedy Space Center (KSC) confirmed the plans in a statement last month before the exact launch date had been set. A SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket with the Arabsat 6A communications satellite aboard is raised to a vertical position for launch later in the day at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida SpaceX completed a static fire of the massive rocket last week ahead of lift-off next week. Smoke can be seen billowing from the vehicle as it fired up its engines ‘A SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket will launch the Arabsat 6A communications satellite, built by Lockheed Martin, from Kennedy Space Center,’ KSC said. ‘The satellite will deliver television, internet and mobile phone services to the Middle East, Africa and Europe,' the statement added. 'Arabsat-6A is part of the two-satellite Arabsat-6G program for Arabsat.’ The launch will be the Falcon Heavy’s first commercial mission, marking an important step forward for its potential use in the future. Falcon Heavy launched for the first time last year, on February 6 following roughly five years of setbacks. Fourteen months after blasting off for the first time to become the most powerful rocket in use today, SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy will take to the skies again on April 9 to complete another critical milestone Falcon Heavy launched for the first time last year, on February 6 following roughly five years of setbacks.

While it isn’t more powerful than NASA’s Saturn V rocket, which took its last flight in 1973, SpaceX’s heavy-lift rocket is the most powerful currently in operation. SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket, which successfully completed its first test flight today, is set to be the largest operational rocket in the world. According to the firm, only the Saturn V moon rocket, which was used to send humans to the moon for the Apollo missions, has delivered more payload to orbit. NASA’s Saturn V, which last flew in 1973, stood 111 meters tall (363 feet) tall. When fully fuelled, it weighed 2.8 million kilograms (6.2 million pounds) – the weight of about 400 elephants. It generated 7.6 million pounds of thrust at launch. The Falcon Heavy, on the other hand, uses three cores – each equipped with 9 engines for a total of 27 Merlin engines. Together, these generate 5.13 million pounds of thrust at liftoff.  The rocket stands 224 feet tall, and weighs 140,660 lbs.

There's a lot riding on its success,"The importance of OfGem introducing financial health tests for would be energy suppliers can be seen by clicking on another headline on its website concerning its appointment of SSE, a member of the big six energy firms, to take on customers of the collapsed Brilliant Energy. Far too many new entrants have ended up in a similarly unhappy place, making victims of their customers who have sometimes been left facing an administrative nightmare, or worse. Millions of Britons are paying more than they need to for their energy, even after the introduction of OfGem's price cap. That will only be addressed if they are willing to switch. The collapse of firms like Brilliant Energy - and there have been 11 such failures over the past six moths - has acted as a powerful disincentive towards their doing that. The new rules, which come into force in June, are designed to address the problem. They will require firms to prove that they can fund their operations adequately for the first year. They will have to pass a fit and proper test, focussing on their mangers and owners. And they will have to prove that they can meet commitments to customer service. The regulations may serve to discourage some perfectly capable firms from taking the plunge because regulations often do that, even when they are perfectly sensible (as these are). But the cost will ultimately be outweighed by the benefits if the requirements serve to reduce the disturbing number of failures we have witnessed. That has to be the regulator’s chief concern. The irony of OfGem selecting SSE to pick up the pieces after the collapse of Brilliant Energy is rich. It is a member of the big six. It was hoped that new entrants like Brilliant would serve to reduce the dominance they have had over the market and lead to lower prices for consumers. The sheer number of failures have ended up pushing them their way, and not just through their picking up the pieces. People with SSE and its peers (British Gas, EDF Energy, E.on, Scottish Power, Npower) may very well feel that it’s a case of better the devil you know even if it means paying more.

It's part of the automaker's push to lead in autonomous vehicles while also trying to catch up to rival Tesla in the emerging electric vehicle market. CNBC sat down with Ford's newly appointed president of its global automotive division, Joe Hinrichs, in recent weeks. The company just announced his promotion in a management shake-up Wednesday along with Jim Farley, who will run the company's autonomous vehicle and ""smart mobility"" efforts, among other things. Although both men will have the title of president starting May 1, Hinrichs' job is bigger and makes him the heir apparent to CEO Jim Hackett. ""Uncertainty"" is one of the things that keeps Hinrichs up at night. And he's facing a lot of it these days. In his newly expanded role, Hinrichs will oversee product development, as well as global automotive operations — core units in the midst of radical change. Ford is pulling out of the sedan and coupe market, even as it invests billions to develop battery cars that have yet to catch on with consumers. Like its rivals, the second-largest Motor City automaker is facing a variety of challenges. Sales have been sliding in the U.S., European operations are losing money and Ford is reportedly considering a major shake-up of its Indian operations, to name just a few challenges Hinrichs has to handle. Now, add the threats posed by the Trump administration's trade wars — tariffs on aluminum and steel last year alone adding $1 billion in costs. Here are some excerpts from CNBC's interviews with Hinrichs: CNBC: A year ago, Ford announced plans to increase its investment in electric and hybrid vehicles to $11.1 billion and a company statement says a ""fresh look"" at the potential market says it's likely to be bigger than initially expected. Hinrichs: We were always confident there would be growth in demand for electric vehicles. As we take a closer look, we're seeing more acceptance. That's especially true among millennials [who], over the next five to 10 years, will be the biggest buying group in the market. The multibillion-dollar question is getting your timing right. We're still trying to find that. We believe electrification is a really important part of our future. CNBC: On the same day Tesla revealed its Model Y electric SUV, Ford teased its own ""Mustang-inspired"" battery-electric crossover on Twitter. It's supposed to be your first long-range model, but when is it coming to market? Hinrichs: We haven't given a timeline, but it's next year, 2020, and we're very excited about it. One of the things that often gets lost in the conversation about electric vehicles, because of the cost, is that there are attributes of a vehicle you can make better with electrification. Along with instant torque, there's the smoothness and quietness of the ride, the low center of gravity. There are fewer moving parts, so reliability [should be better]. And the way you can use the package gets more efficient because you don't have all that stuff in the engine compartment up front. CNBC: The $900 milliion investment also includes money for autonomous vehicles. What are you planning? Hinrichs: We found a more capital-intensive way of building [autonomous vehicles]. So, we're going to build them in a special manufacturing center the same way we produce our police interceptor in Chicago. [Ford takes a regular vehicle off the line and sends it to a special conversion center.] That allows us to produce the same number of vehicles but frees up capital for the second battery plant. CNBC: In January, you announced what was said to be the first of several possible deals with Volkswagen, including one that could pair up your EV programs. Where do things stand now? Hinrichs: We made the announcement on partnering on vans and trucks outside North America. Those conversations, I would say, went very well. There's a good matching up of needs and strengths. We're very excited about that alliance. We signed an MoU about continuing to have discussions on other topics, and those conversations are going well. There's a good alignment and the talks are going well, which is as far as I can go. CNBC: But Farley, who is currently president of the Americas, seemed to recently dash expectations, saying it will be hard to come together on electric vehicles because the timing of your programs is different. Hinrichs: Timing is always a challenge when you're talking to a partner about how your needs and programs line up. But those conversations continue to go well. CNBC: Speaking of a changing market, the industry is in the midst of a dramatic shift from cars to trucks which now account for 70% of the U.S. market. Is there much room for more growth? Hinrichs: I would say that it's gone further than I estimated it would and it is still going. There are a few key contributors. The [light trucks] we offer today don't have the compromises they did in the 1990s. Now, you don't have to give up the ride comfort and the relative difference in fuel economy has diminished significantly. The cost of gas has certainly had an influence. I also think our society has gotten used to the idea that devices can do all sorts of things. Your smartphone is your rolodex, your phone, your camera. Society now expects vehicles to be multi-functional, too. So, I don't think it will stop. CNBC: Since a management shake-up nearly two years ago, Ford has been going through a lot of changes. What can you tell us about the planned Ford reorganization? Hinrichs: You mean the ""smart redesign"" we started last fall which is really about flattening the organization and removing some of the bureaucracy. We want to let the people running each layer of the organization handle that redesign, rather than from the top down. We think we'll get bigger insight and a bigger buy-in. CNBC: How is that different from your broader global restructuring? Hinrichs: We've already announced plans for our Brazilian [truck plant] in Sao Bernardo to close, and that's our first big step there. In Europe, we don't have a lot to announce because we're in discussions with our partners, but we're having very constructive and engaging discussions. We've set up our China operations as a standalone business under Jim Farley and we're looking at everything in our China business. CNBC: What about North America? Hinrichs: We don't have as deep a restructuring as in those other markets, but we're looking at the cost structure and execution of the launch of some very important products over the next few years that will have a big impact on our business — the new Ranger [pickup], the Explorer and Aviator and Escape [SUVs] this year and then a number of incremental nameplates the next year, including the Bronco and the 300-mile all-electric SUV. And we're keeping our trucks super fresh. In North America, we think we're going into a really sweet spot over the next 18 months. CNBC: We've heard about job cuts in Latin America and Europe, as well as white-collar cuts in North America. What about blue-collar cuts in the home market where General Motors has eliminated five plants and thousands of hourly jobs? Hinrichs: In December we announced that both Louisville and Flat Rock will remove a shift but we plan to move those people to where we need more capacity like the Livonia transmission and Kentucky Truck Plant. So, in North America, with all the product launches coming, we don't see substantial assembly plant changes coming in the near future. CNBC: So, hourly workers don't need to worry? Hinrichs: If the U.S. economy stays strong and the industry stays where it is, I don't see dramatic changes to our manufacturing plans for this year in North America. CNBC: But how concerned are you about the U.S. economy? Hinrichs: This ""peak auto"" story has been around for several years. It wouldn't surprise me, given where we are in the U.S. economic and automotive cycle that people are being cautious about hiring. January and February sales were down but they were impacted by severe weather. We'll see what the spring selling season brings. It usually tells a better tale of what the year will hold. But there's clearly a lot of uncertainty out there. CNBC: ""Uncertainty"" is a word I've heard a lot from you and other industry officials lately. Are we in a more uncertain period than the industry has faced in a long time? Hinrichs: It's fair to say that we're in the most uncertain period since the global financial crisis. We have a U.S. government engaging in trade negotiations with multiple [nations] at the same time, which is unprecedented. And there's a very important review of [U.S.] fuel economy standards. Given our cycle times and the capital exposures we have, we crave certainty for planning, as much as possible. So, when you add everything going on, the industry is going to get more conservative because we don't know where to place all our bets. CNBC: Ford is heavily dependent on the U.S. market, but don't you have a lot at risk now in Britain. Hinrichs: Brexit, on its own, is both fascinating and scary all on its own, because the U.K. is very important business for us. I'd be surprised if [a ""hard Brexit""] is the probable outcome. Maybe it's my personality but I'm always optimistic that, at the end of the day, people will find a resolution because it's in nobody's interest for there to be a no-deal Brexit with chaos.

The Nikkei Asian Review reported Thursday that Panasonic and Tesla are reconsidering plans to increase the factory's capacity 50 percent by 2020, as investors increasingly worry about possibly weakening demand for Tesla cars. Tesla shares fell 3% in intraday trading Thursday. The $4.5 billion Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada, is where Panasonic and Tesla jointly make the battery packs for Tesla's cars and energy storage products, and where parts of the Model 3 sedan are made. Tesla said in its fourth-quarter letter to shareholders that it will ""most likely"" build the recently unveiled Model Y crossover at the factory. The news comes a week after Tesla released quarterly delivery numbers that missed Wall Street expectations by a wide margin. Tesla did say U.S. orders for Model 3 vehicles significantly outpaced what it was able to deliver in the first quarter, and the company reaffirmed its prior guidance of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries in 2019. Here is Tesla's full statement: ""Both Tesla and Panasonic continue to invest substantial funds into Gigafactory. That said, we believe there is far more output to be gained from improving existing production equipment than was previously estimated. We are seeing significant gains from upgrading existing lines to increase output, which allows Tesla and Panasonic to achieve the same output with less spent on new equipment purchases. However, we will of course continue to make new investments in Gigafactory 1, as needed. Most importantly, contrary to what is implied in this report, our demand for cells continues to outpace supply. It remains the fundamental constraint on Tesla vehicle and Powerwall/Powerpack production."" Panasonic did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

The REC Foundation’s VEX Robotics World Championship is a week-long event celebrating hands-on STEM learning. Held April 24 – 30 at the Kentucky Exposition Center, the world’s top teams gather to compete in robotics competitions focused on creative design and problem solving. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190411005100/en/ The Competition The REC Foundation’s VEX Competitions make up the largest and fastest growing robotics engineering platform in the world consisting of the following programs: the VEX IQ Challenge (Elementary & Middle School), the VEX Robotics Competition (Middle School & High School) and VEX U (College/University). 24,000 robotics teams from all 50 states and 60 countries compete in these programs on a local level throughout the year. Out of this group, 1,650 teams qualify to attend the REC Foundation’s VEX Robotics World Championship based on their success at their state and regional championships. “With the demand for STEM-related skills growing at such a fast pace, competitions like this help spark student interest and excitement in technology and pursuing high-tech careers,” said Dan Mantz, CEO of the REC Foundation. In fact, a June 2018 study by The REC Foundation showed that nine out of 10 students express interest in pursuing STEM careers after participating in the VEX Robotics Competition. Mantz continued, “Each year during the world championship, I look around at the diverse group of bright students gathered from around the world, and realize I’m looking at the faces of the future of innovation. It’s really astounding.” This year, more than 25,000 people are expected to attend the competition. “Every day we’re focused on bringing hands-on STEM learning experiences to students around the globe” said Tony Norman, Co-Founder and President of VEX Robotics. “The VEX World Championship is the culmination of that education, and seeing the excitement, passion and creativity of these young students shows we have a bright future ahead.” Girl Powered + #IamRemarkable The REC Foundation and VEX Robotics also promote teamwork, collaboration and diversity within the STEM community through programs such as  Girl Powered. The Girl Powered initiative provides tools and resources to students and mentors to promote female involvement in STEM and helps create an environment where students’ confidence and abilities can flourish. Google recently expanded its partnership with the REC Foundation, and at the world championship event this year, Dr. Njema Frazier, nuclear physicist for the Department of Energy, will introduce #IamRemarkable, Google’s initiative empowering women and underrepresented groups, that will now include high school girls. “I was a high school student when I learned that I was especially talented in math and science and what I thought was normal aptitude in mathematics was, in fact, exceptional. It was that knowledge that gave me the confidence to major in physics,” said Frazier. “That’s why working with Google to announce the extension of the #IamRemarkable campaign to high school girls during the REC Foundation’s VEX Robotics World Championship is so meaningful. Females have an untapped genius to apply in the STEM space, and yet we are underrepresented. I say, it’s about time we changed that.” Sponsors The REC Foundation’s VEX Robotics World Championship is presented by the Northrop Grumman Foundation. Other Global Sponsors who support the program year-round and at the world championship include: Autodesk, Dell, Google, HEXBUG, IFI NASA, Rack Solutions, Robomatter, Tesla, Texas Instruments, Toyota, TVA, VEX Robotics, MathWorks, Microchip, UPS, Nordson, Nissan, Robot Mesh, Advanced Manufacturing and Logistic Network, Kentucky Tourism, Arts & Heritage Cabinet, Maker Mobile, Inc., TATA consulting, and ZEON.

Now, those customers don't know when their orders will arrive. (TSLA)","Customers have waited over three years for the $35,000, base-price version of Tesla's Model 3 sedan. In March, they received the latest in a series of delays. On February 28, Tesla began allowing customers to place orders for the $35,000 Model 3, known as the standard-range trim, saying the vehicles would be delivered in two to four weeks. Less than two weeks later, the electric carmaker said deliveries for new orders would take six to eight weeks. Five standard-range-Model 3 customers who spoke with Business Insider have been given indefinite delivery timelines. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Read more: The biggest question for Tesla is whether the company can make steady profits on its cars ""This sure as hell sounds like a bait and switch to me,"" said Bob Whiteman, who lives in San Francisco and made a $1,000 reservation for the standard-range Model 3 on the first possible day: March 31, 2016. Whiteman paid a $2,500 deposit to order the vehicle on February 28. He says that while he was given a two- to four-week delivery timeline when he placed his order, he was skeptical. ""Considering I had seen estimate ranges like that from Tesla many, many times over — all of them dramatically broken — I put very little stake in that,"" he said. On March 22, Whiteman received a text from Tesla setting a tentative delivery date of March 30, which gave him confidence his Model 3 would arrive soon. Two days later, however, Tesla sent him a text delaying his delivery indefinitely. ""Our apologies, we will need to reschedule your delivery appointment to a later date,"" the text said. ""A Tesla representative will reach out when we have a better estimate of your delivery timing."" Whiteman said he no longer trusted Tesla's projections for when his Model 3 would arrive. ""I have no reason to believe any dates from Tesla,"" he said. Three other Model 3 customers who spoke with Business Insider received the same text as Whiteman after getting tentative delivery dates scheduled for late March. Another Model 3 customer was sent a similar message via email, though he had not been given a delivery date. ""I am not able to give you a firm estimation on delivery for your car,"" the email said. ""However, you will get a notification when your Model 3 is almost at the end of line."" Brent Hyden, who lives in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, reserved his standard-range Model 3 in March 2016. When he placed his order on March 1, he recalls, he found the two- to four-week delivery time frame ""kind of odd"" since he suspected there would be high demand for the $35,000 model. On March 22, Tesla gave Hyden a tentative March 28 delivery date; on March 24, he received the rescheduling text. A few days later, a Tesla employee called Hyden and told him he could receive a Model 3 by the end of March if he upgraded from the standard-range trim to the standard-range-plus trim, which adds 20 miles of range for an extra $2,500. Hyden said he wasn't interested. The employee told Hyden the standard-range Model 3 probably wouldn't be available until the end of June, Hyden said. While he's still excited for his Model 3, Hyden said, he's been disappointed with Tesla's communication. ""I'd feel a lot better about my experience with the company if they were just up front, open, and honest,"" he said. ""I just don't want to feel like I'm being taken advantage of."" Not all standard-range Model 3 customers are upset with Tesla. Celia Chiang, who lives in San Jose, California, made a March 2016 reservation and ordered her Model 3 on February 28. While she didn't expect a three-year wait, she said she understood why, from a financial perspective, Tesla had delayed standard-range deliveries. ""It's completely OK with me,"" she said. ""I want them to do well. I want them to make money."" Tesla CEO Elon Musk expressed a similar sentiment in May, saying Tesla would ""lose money and die"" if it started building and delivering the standard-range Model 3 back then. In June, Musk said Tesla would most likely begin making $35,000 Model 3s near the end of 2018 and aim for mass production in early 2019. Tesla did not respond when asked whether production for the standard-range Model 3 had begun. Have you worked for Tesla? Do you have a story to share?

Michigan Democrats Sen. Debbie Stabenow, Sen. Gary Peters and Rep. Dan Kildee joined with Tennessee Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander and Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins to propose the legislation, which they say would increase production in electric vehicles and create jobs. Currently, customers who buy electric cars receive a $7,500 tax credit. But it phases out after an automaker sells 200,000 vehicles. Tesla (TSLA) was first to hit the cap last year, and responded by cutting the price of its cars by $2,000. GM (GM) exceeded 200,000 vehicles sold earlier this year, and has warned that sales of their plug-in cars, like the Chevrolet Bolt and Volt, could drop as the tax credit phases out. The proposed legislation would raise the cap, so that another 400,000 vehicles sold by each manufacturer will be eligible for a $7,000 tax credit. It would start phasing out after 600,000 vehicles are sold. ""At a time when climate change is having a real effect on Michigan, today's legislation is something we can do now to reduce emissions and combat carbon pollution,"" Stabenow said in a statement. ""Our bill will help create American jobs and cement Michigan's status as an advanced manufacturing hub,"" she added. Alexander applauded how far the electric car industry has come over the past decade. ""Investing in American research and technology for better electric vehicles is one way to help our country and the world deal with climate change,"" he said. The proposal could get pushback from the Trump administration. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said in December that the president wants to end the electric vehicle tax credit, the Wall Street Journal reported. ""As a matter of our policy, we want to end all those subsidies,"" Kudlow said. The comment came days after Trump threatened to end subsidies for GM, in response to the automaker's announcement that it would but cutting thousands of jobs.

At present, semis and other long-haul trucks are mostly diesel-powered, so they emit nitrogen oxides and particulates that aren't just bad for the climate; they're bad for human health as well.

One way to curb freight emissions: Put trucks on an electric catenary system
Tesla made a splash in 2017 when it introduced its all-electric semi truck, and announcements from other trucking companies followed. Daimler sold small electric delivery trucks and has an electric Cascadia in development, Nikola announced a hydrogen-powered fuel cell truck, and Siemens debuted a catenary system for freight. Yet two years later, trucking in the US is still driven by diesel-fueled, compression-ignition (CI), internal combustion engines. Daniel Cohn and Leslie Bromberg, a pair of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), published a paper with the Society of Automotive Engineers, suggesting that the best way forward is not to wait for all-electric or hydrogen-powered semis, but to build a plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV) truck with an internal combustion engine/generator that can burn either gasoline or renewable ethanol or methanol. Such a setup preserves the range and affordability that's expected of diesel long-haul trucks while significantly reducing the emissions associated with diesel. To boot, it's a near-term solution; no waiting for battery weight to fall or hydrogen refueling stations to be installed. Why find an alternative approach A hybrid heavy-duty system isn't a completely novel idea, though a PHEV system has yet to be widely applied and tested in long-haul heavy-duty trucking. A company called Hyliion introduced a hybrid electric-diesel truck in 2017, and San Diego uses a hybrid electric-compressed natural gas bus on its transit system, though the former still grapples with diesel emissions and the latter is not for long-haul use. But there are some distinct problems with all-electric and all-diesel trucks that a hybrid flex-fuel truck could solve. First, freight companies are looking for the cheapest way to transport goods from point A to point B, so expensive electric vehicles don't make short-term economic sense, especially if you're competing with other freight companies using cheaper diesel engines. But cheap diesel engines aren't a magic bullet either. As electric vehicle advocates will point out, internal combustion engines are usually cheaper upfront, but volatile fuel costs can drive up the total cost of ownership of a fossil fuel-powered car. In addition, states with strict air quality standards like California impose a Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which increases the price of diesel. In ports and highly populated cities, a PHEV truck could rely on battery power for short distances to comply with metropolitan air quality standards. With a truck that can run on electricity, gas, and renewably sourced ethanol or methanol, trucking companies can make the best of several worlds. Although gas-powered spark ignition (SI) vehicles are usually less efficient than diesel-powered compression ignition vehicles, the researchers say that SI inefficiencies are mostly found during light load operations where the truck's battery could take over. Additional modifications to a hybrid truck drivetrain could further reduce the gap in efficiency between the flex-fuel engine and a comparable diesel engine (some of these modifications include increasing the compression ratio of the engine or decreasing the size of a gas engine). The researchers used computer modeling to show that, with specific modifications, such an engine setup would have efficiency comparable to that of diesel engines. Getting to low emissions quickly Using flex-fuel gasoline-alcohol engines has also been shown to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by 90 percent, the MIT researchers wrote, if the emissions reduction system on the truck uses a three-way catalyst (TWC) instead of the diesel-focused selective catalytic reduction (SCR). (The paper notes that this isn't theoretical. A 90-percent reduction in tailpipe NOx from diesel has already been achieved in light-duty gas vehicles and in the heavy-duty Cummins Westport 9 liter natural gas engine.) A flex-fuel gasoline-alcohol engine could also help freight companies achieve ""both the lowest air pollution and lowest greenhouse gas emissions when the internal combustion engine operates,"" the paper notes. In addition, ""the relative use of battery power, gasoline power, and alcohol power can be optimized for meeting varying prices and availability of these energy sources as a long-haul truck travels through various regions."" What about practical applications? The researchers note that they only did the computer modeling to show that such a system would be as efficient and clean as a diesel setup, but ""more detailed engine modeling"" is necessary to bring an electric flex-fuel hybrid truck to market. However, the private sector does seem to have dipped its toes in hybrid long-haul truck powertrains. In 2017, truck engine maker Cummins announced that it would be developing a 100-mile-range electric semi with a diesel generator on board that could extend the battery range to 300 miles. Last September, the company debuted a hybrid electric and diesel or natural gas powertrain called the PowerDrive. ""The PowerDrive replaces the conventional transmission and switches in real time between two hybrid and two pure electric modes, optimizing the powertrain for the best fuel economics in any driving situation,"" a Cummins press release stated. The crucial point, though, is that a hybrid electric truck is more accessible to freight companies right now, and, at a time where carbon emissions need to be curtailed as quickly as possible, waiting for an all-electric or hydrogen fuel cell truck may simply make perfect the enemy of the good.",mit says overlooking solution diesel trucking emissions,transportation one major causes greenhouse gas emissions us trucks account quarter emissions present semis trucks mostly emit nitrogen oxides particulates bad climate bad human health well reading one way curb freight emissions put trucks electric catenary system tesla made splash introduced semi truck announcements trucking companies followed daimler sold small electric delivery trucks electric cascadia development nikola announced fuel cell truck siemens debuted catenary system freight yet two years later trucking us still driven ci internal combustion engines daniel cohn leslie bromberg pair researchers massachusetts institute technology mit published paper society automotive engineers suggesting best way forward wait semis build hybrid electric phev truck internal combustion burn either gasoline renewable ethanol methanol setup preserves range affordability expected diesel trucks significantly reducing emissions associated diesel boot solution waiting battery weight fall hydrogen refueling stations installed find alternative approach hybrid system completely novel idea though phev system yet widely applied tested trucking company called hyliion introduced hybrid truck san diego uses hybrid natural gas bus transit system though former still grapples diesel emissions latter use distinct problems trucks hybrid truck could solve first freight companies looking cheapest way transport goods point point b expensive electric vehicles make economic sense especially competing freight companies using cheaper diesel engines cheap diesel engines magic bullet either electric vehicle advocates point internal combustion engines usually cheaper upfront volatile fuel costs drive total cost ownership fossil car addition states strict air quality standards like california impose low carbon fuel standard increases price diesel ports highly populated cities phev truck could rely battery power short distances comply metropolitan air quality standards truck run electricity gas renewably sourced ethanol methanol trucking companies make best several worlds although spark ignition si vehicles usually less efficient compression ignition vehicles researchers say si inefficiencies mostly found light load operations truck battery could take additional modifications hybrid truck drivetrain could reduce gap efficiency engine comparable diesel engine modifications include increasing compression ratio engine decreasing size gas engine researchers used computer modeling show specific modifications engine setup would efficiency comparable diesel engines getting low emissions quickly using engines also shown reduce nitrogen oxide emissions percent mit researchers wrote emissions reduction system truck uses catalyst twc instead selective catalytic reduction scr paper notes theoretical reduction tailpipe nox diesel already achieved gas vehicles cummins westport liter natural gas engine engine could also help freight companies achieve lowest air pollution lowest greenhouse gas emissions internal combustion engine operates paper notes addition relative use battery power gasoline power alcohol power optimized meeting varying prices availability energy sources truck travels various regions practical applications researchers note computer modeling show system would efficient clean diesel setup detailed engine modeling necessary bring electric hybrid truck market however private sector seem dipped toes hybrid truck powertrains truck engine maker cummins announced would developing electric semi diesel generator board could extend battery range miles last september company debuted hybrid electric diesel natural gas powertrain called powerdrive powerdrive replaces conventional transmission switches real time two hybrid two pure electric modes optimizing powertrain best fuel economics driving situation cummins press release stated crucial point though hybrid electric truck accessible freight companies right time carbon emissions need curtailed quickly possible waiting hydrogen fuel cell truck may simply make perfect enemy good

The ride-hailing giant made its paperwork public for the first time on Thursday, providing us the first comprehensive look under the hood at the company's financials, risk factors, and more. And one glaring risk factor is likely to be at the top of all investors minds. ""Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects,"" the company said in the filing. It's a fairly standard line for many companies in their risk factors, but with Uber it takes on even more importance given the company's history of scandals that eventually led to the departure of founder and then-CEO Travis Kalanick. ""We have previously received significant media coverage and negative publicity, particularly in 2017, regarding our brand and reputation, and failure to rehabilitate our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer,"" the company said of the most high-profile scandal, ignited by the now-former employer Susan Fowler in a damning blog post about her time at Uber. Read more: Uber pays hundreds of women and men of color a total of $10 million to settle a discrimination lawsuit Last month, Lyft told investors in its IPO filing that it had benefitted from the very #deleteuber campaign that Uber is warning about. ""In 2017, the #DeleteUber campaign prompted hundreds of thousands of consumers to stop using our platform within days,"" Uber said. ""Subsequently, our reputation was further harmed when an employee published a blog post alleging, among other things, that we had a toxic culture and that certain sexual harassment and discriminatory practices occurred in our workplace."" Uber said it plans to release a transparency report this year to address some of these prior problems, but the reactions to that could also result in a reputation hit. ""The public responses to this transparency report or similar public reporting of safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators, may result in negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users.""",uber warns reputation may always risk continued success uber,uber officially filed go public giant made paperwork public first time thursday providing us first comprehensive look hood company financials risk factors one glaring risk factor likely top investors minds maintaining enhancing brand reputation critical business prospects company said filing fairly standard line many companies risk factors uber takes even importance given company history scandals eventually led departure founder travis kalanick previously received significant media coverage negative publicity particularly regarding brand reputation failure rehabilitate brand reputation cause business suffer company said scandal ignited employer susan fowler damning blog post time uber read uber pays hundreds women men color total million settle discrimination lawsuit last month lyft told investors ipo filing benefitted deleteuber campaign uber warning deleteuber campaign prompted hundreds thousands consumers stop using platform within days uber said subsequently reputation harmed employee published blog post alleging among things toxic culture certain sexual harassment discriminatory practices occurred workplace uber said plans release transparency report year address prior problems reactions could also result reputation hit public responses transparency report similar public reporting safety incidents claimed occurred platform may include disclosure reports provided regulators may result negative media coverage increased regulatory scrutiny could adversely affect reputation platform users

On Thursday, Uber finally filed its S-1 paperwork to go public in the coming weeks, offering an unprecedented look at the inner workings of the ride-hailing company. It also provides fresh insight into what the Silicon Valley mega-startup views as some of the biggest risks facing it today — and Google and Apple's dominance of the modern app-powered tech industry makes the list. ""Our platform relies on third parties maintaining open marketplaces, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which make applications available for download,"" it tells potential investors. ""We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform will maintain their current structures or that such marketplaces will not charge us fees to list our applications for download."" The warning highlights the near-total dependence modern app developers have today on the proprietors the Android and iOs app stores. Both companies take a standard 30% cut of most transactions, and these apps are entirely at the mercy of each store's rules on what is and isn't allowed — a state of affairs that has sparked increasing resentment in the digital industry in recent years. Spotify has publicly attacked Apple's App Store, alleging it abuses its power, and has formally complained with the European Commission. Epic Games, the makers of wildly popular game ""Fortnite,"" declined to make the game available on Android's Google Play store, instead requiring users to download it directly from the company's servers. Uber clearly harbours the same concerns about reliance on these companies. But its warnings extend beyond the app stores alone, also flagging its reliance on Google Maps as a potential vulnerability. ""We rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our products and offerings, including Google Maps for the mapping function that is critical to the functionality of our platform,"" it writes. ""We do not believe that an alternative mapping solution exists that can provide the global functionality that we require to offer our platform in all of the markets in which we operate ... If such third parties cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Drivers use, do not provide access to such software on terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we may be required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or inferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely affect our business."" Between the start of 2016 and the end of 2018, Uber paid Google around $58 million for access to its Google Maps service, the S-1 discloses. The warning also highlights the twisted nature of Uber and Google's tensions. Most directly, Google's sister company Waymo is building self-driving vehicles that aim to directly compete with Uber's business. But Google's privileged position at the top of the app store food chain means Uber is simultaneously dependent on it to survive. And all the while, Google's parent company Alphabet is an investor in Uber, following a high profile trade-secrets lawsuit between Waymo and Uber. Got a tip?

SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket launched at the top of its window on Thursday evening from Florida, and soared into space under clear skies. First, the two side boosters separated. And then the center core detached from the second stage, which carried its satellite payload on toward geostationary orbit. Then, the fun began. In something of a space ballet, the two side boosters reentered Earth's atmosphere, and then made controlled burns to land within meters of one another at sites along the Florida coast. A few minutes later the center core, burning its engines hard, landed on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean. Original post: On Wednesday evening, SpaceX ended its first attempt to fly the Falcon Heavy rocket and its Arabsat-6A payload in the middle of a two-hour launch window. The upper-level wind shear was unacceptable, and with a poor forecast, it just didn't make sense to load kerosene and oxygen on the rocket. Now, the rocket is back on the launch pad for another attempt Thursday, with a similar launch window, opening at 6:35pm ET (10:35 UTC) and closing at 8:31pm ET (00:31 UTC). The upper-level wind forecast for this evening is considerably better. This will be the Falcon Heavy rocket's second flight, following a successful first launch in February 2018, during which the company famously flung Elon Musk's cherry red Tesla Roadster into deep space. Starman is still out there, by the way, in an elliptical orbit around the Sun. Earth-based telescopes may be able to see him in the early 2020s, certainly no later than 2047. Although the Falcon Heavy has proven itself flight-worthy, this is still just the second launch of a rocket with a staggering 27 engines, so there is definitely some uncertainty. Although SpaceX has made ""many good design improvements"" from the rocket that launched 14 months ago, Musk said there is a 5 to 10 percent chance of failure with this mission. Ahead of Thursday's launch attempt, the company said the rocket—composed of three Falcon 9, Block 5 cores—remains in good condition. Each of the three cores is new, and SpaceX is counting on re-using the two side boosters for another Falcon Heavy mission as early as June—the launch of the US Air Force’s Space Test Program-2 mission carrying several military and scientific research satellites. To facilitate this, the two side boosters will attempt to land back at SpaceX’s Landing Zones 1 and 2 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, while the center core will attempt to land on the Of Course I Still Love You drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean. During the rocket's first launch in 2018, the side boosters made it, but the center core missed its drone ship landing. The webcast should begin about 20 minutes before the rocket's anticipated liftoff. It will include coverage of the landing attempts and satellite deploy.",falcon heavy ready second attempt second flight,et update well exhilarating spacex falcon heavy rocket launched top window thursday evening florida soared space clear skies first two side boosters separated center core detached second stage carried satellite payload toward geostationary orbit fun began something space ballet two side boosters reentered earth atmosphere made controlled burns land within meters one another sites along florida coast minutes later center core burning engines hard landed drone ship atlantic ocean original post wednesday evening spacex ended first attempt fly falcon heavy rocket payload middle launch window wind shear unacceptable poor forecast make sense load kerosene oxygen rocket rocket back launch pad another attempt thursday similar launch window opening et utc closing et utc wind forecast evening considerably better falcon heavy rocket second flight following successful first launch february company famously flung elon musk cherry red tesla roadster deep space starman still way elliptical orbit around sun telescopes may able see early certainly later although falcon heavy proven still second launch rocket staggering engines definitely uncertainty although spacex made many good design improvements rocket launched months ago musk said percent chance failure mission ahead thursday launch attempt company said three falcon block good condition three cores new spacex counting two side boosters another falcon heavy mission early launch us air force space test mission carrying several military scientific research satellites facilitate two side boosters attempt land back spacex landing zones cape canaveral air force station center core attempt land course still love drone ship atlantic ocean rocket first launch side boosters made center core missed drone ship landing webcast begin minutes rocket anticipated liftoff include coverage landing attempts satellite deploy

Uber named the following direct competitors... ""Waymo has already introduced a commercialized ridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our other competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will,"" the company wrote in the Risk Factors section of its S-1 filing. Driverless vehicles are important to Uber, in part, because its ""business would be adversely affected if drivers were classified as employees instead of independent contractors,"" it disclosed in the same filing. And it's consistently challenging for Uber to keep drivers loyal to its platform. Uber also spoke plainly about its losses to date and warned investors that it expects operating costs to increase and that it may not achieve profitability. As of Dec. 31, 2018, Uber had racked up an accumulated deficit of $7.9 billion. The company also alluded to the wave of scandals and negative press coverage in 2017 that eventually led to the ouster of former CEO Travis Kalanick: In 2017, the #DeleteUber campaign prompted hundreds of thousands of consumers to stop using our platform within days. Subsequently, our reputation was further harmed when an employee published a blog post alleging, among other things, that we had a toxic culture and that certain sexual harassment and discriminatory practices occurred in our workplace. Shortly thereafter, we had a number of highly publicized events and allegations, including investigations related to a software tool allegedly designed to evade and deceive authorities, a high-profile lawsuit filed against us by Waymo, and our disclosure of a data security breach. Elsewhere in the filing, Uber notes: ""We are on a new path forward with the hiring of our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi in September 2017 following many challenges regarding our culture, workplace practices, and reputation."" Uber's risk factors comprised 48 pages of its 285-page prospectus for investors weighing the company's potential ahead of its IPO, which is expected later this year. Archrival Lyft's risk factors comprised 42 pages of a 220-page prospectus. Lyft expressed similar concerns in its S-1 filing around its quest to achieve profitability, ability to attract and retain drivers, especially. Lyft named the following direct competitors... However, Lyft's business is more limited in scope than Uber's. Lyft is only operating in North America today, and it is primarily concerned with moving people, not food and freight.

The 23-storey-tall Heavy, which previously launched Musk's cherry red Tesla roadster to space in a 2018 debut test flight, blasted off from Florida's Kennedy Space Center carrying its first customer payload. ""T plus 33 seconds into flight, under the power of 5.1 million pounds of thrust, Falcon Heavy is headed to space,"" SpaceX launch commentator John Insprucker said on a livestream. Roughly three minutes after clearing the pad, Heavy's two side boosters separated from the core rocket for a synchronized landing at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The middle booster, after pushing the payload into space, returned nearly 10 minutes later for a successful landing on SpaceX's seafaring drone ship 645 kilometres off the Florida coast. In the 2018 test mission, Heavy's core booster missed the vessel and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. Liftoff with Heavy's new military-certified Falcon 9 boosters was crucial in the race with Boeing-Lockheed venture United Launch Alliance and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin as Musk's SpaceX, working to flight-prove its rocket fleet one mission at a time, aims to clinch a third of all U.S. National Security Space missions — coveted military contracts worth billions. The U.S. Air Force tapped SpaceX in 2018 to launcha classified military satellite  for $130 million US. In February, it added three more missions in a $297-million contract.

But even so, it warns investors, they could be a total bust for the company. On Thursday, Uber finally filed its S-1 paperwork to go public in the coming weeks, offering an unprecedented look at the inner workings of the ride-hailing company. It also provides fresh insight into how the Silicon Valley mega-startup views the promise — and perils — of autonomous vehicles. ""We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies will enable a product that competes with the cost of personal vehicle ownership and usage, and represents the future of transportation,"" Uber's paperwork says, adding that it believes believes the tech ""will be an important part of our platform over the long term."" In 2018, the company spent $457 million on its autonomous vehicle-focused Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) and other tech initiatives — including Uber Elevate, its futuristic urban aircraft program. Long term, Uber hopes the self-driving car tech will allow it to end its dependence on human drivers in favor of a fleet of cheaper autonomous vehicles that don't need to be paid wages. But despite investing hundreds of millions of dollars in self-driving car technology, Uber still warns that it might screw up — and says it expects its competitors to be able to commercial ise the tech ""at scale"" before it can. ""We have invested, and we expect to continue to invest, substantial amounts in autonomous vehicle technologies. As discussed elsewhere in this prospectus, we believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete,"" the company wrote. ""While we believe that autonomous vehicles present substantial opportunities, the development of such technology is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful. Several other companies ... are also developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the personal mobility, meal delivery, or logistics industries. We expect certain competitors to commercialize autonomous vehicle technologies at scale before we do."" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi.
Carlo Allegri/Reuters Uber calls out Google cousin company Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox, Aptiv, May Mobility, Pronto.ai, Aurora, and Nuro as the companies all racing to conquer the self-driving mobility market — citing Waymo as a particular threat due to the development of its commercialized fleet. If these rivals do manage to scale up self-driving tech before Uber does, then numerous areas of its business could be at risk. ""In the event that our competitors bring autonomous vehicles to market before we do, or their technology is or is perceived to be superior to ours, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which would adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects,"" it wrote. ""For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providing ridesharing, meal delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available to consumers on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors' offerings over ours, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted."" Similarly, even sourcing parts and securing suppliers could prove problematic in the experimental field, it warns — especially in the event of external events like currency market fluctuations, new tariffs or trade wars, or theft. And all this high-tech development is capital intensive: There's no guarantee that Uber will be ""to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, [in which case] our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges and competition may be significantly limited."" Uber doesn't anticipate eliminating all traditional human drivers overnight once the tech reaches maturity. Instead, the company predicts a ""hybrid"" period, ""in which autonomous vehicles will be deployed gradually against specific use cases while Drivers continue to serve most consumer demand ... Such situations may include trips along a standard, well-mapped route in a predictable environment in good weather."" This prompts another, related risk: The pursuit of autonomous technology might spark discontent among Uber's existing base of human drivers, with unpredictable consequences. The efforts may ""add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers,"" the S-1 warns. ""Driver dissatisfaction has in the past resulted in protests by Drivers, most recently in India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and any future protests may result, in interruptions to our business. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our number of platform users, which would reduce our network liquidity, and which in turn may cause a further decline in platform usage."" The disclosures echo earlier remarks by former CEO Travis Kalanick, who described the technology as an ""existential"" risk to the company. ""It starts with understanding that the world is going to go self-driving and autonomous,"" he told Business Insider in 2016. ""So if that's happening, what would happen if we weren't a part of that future? If we weren't part of the autonomy thing?

The massive rocket stormed into the atmosphere carrying a communication satellite. The two first-stage boosters landed back at Cape Canaveral, just as they did during Falcon Heavy's first launch in 2018. The central booster self-landed onto a barge-like drone ship called ""Of Course I Still Love You."" Recapturing the three 16-story boosters, as SpaceX did on Thursday night, will help the company recoup tens of millions of dollars in hardware and reuse them for future launches. Falcon Heavy stands about 230 feet tall and is the world's most powerful operational rocket. The vehicle lifted off the first time on February 6, 2018, propelling one of company founder Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster electric cars beyond the orbit of Mars. ""Life cannot just be about solving one sad problem after another,"" Musk said after the experimental launch. ""There need to be things that inspire you, that make you glad to wake up in the morning and be part of humanity. That is why we did it. We did for you."" The launch was also a $500 million advertisement: SpaceX proved that its powerful new three-booster launch vehicle worked, attracting a suite of customers that included the Department of Defense and the Arab Satellite Communications Organization, or Arabsat — a Saudi Arabian satellite operator. Arabsat-6A is a roughly 13,200-pound satellite built by Lockheed Martin. It's designed to ""deliver television, radio, Internet, and mobile communications to customers in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe,"" according to a SpaceX press kit. The launch was originally scheduled for Wednesday night, but high-altitude shear winds, which can blow at more than 100 mph, proved too much of a risk to the rocket. (Musk has previously said shear winds can hit a rocket ""like a sledgehammer"" while it's traveling at supersonic speeds.) Weather conditions for Thursday evening were far better, though. ""All systems and weather are currently go ahead of tonight's Falcon Heavy launch of Arabsat-6A from Pad 39A; launch window opens at 6:35 p.m. EDT,"" the company tweeted on Thursday.

The megarocket, equipped with the most powerful booster, launched the Arabsat-6A communication satellite into orbit from NASA&aposs Kennedy Space Centre in Florida at 6:35pm local time. The original launch was scheduled on Wednesday but cancelled due to uncooperative weather. It has been fourteen months since its maiden launch that carried a red Tesla Roadster, and this time Falcon Heavy will be using the upgraded Block 5 hardware, which gives it a 10 per cent boost in maximum thrust over its predecessor, said the company&aposs CEO Elon Musk. At the eighth minute after launch, both Falcon Heavy&aposs side booster have accurately landed at SpaceX Landing Zones 1 and 2 at Cape Canaveral, not far from the launchpad. Two minutes later, the core booster, which went higher and farther, set down on the &aposOf Course I Still Love You&apos droneship in the Atlantic Ocean. At the 34th minute, SpaceX has announced the successful deployment of Arabsat-6A satellite, meaning Falcon Heavy has completed its first commercial mission. SpaceX has livestreamed the launch on their website as crowds can be heard cheering while witnessing the event. The additional thrust is claimed to allow the rocket to propel 140,000 pounds to low-Earth orbit, nearly three times what the Falcon 9 can lift. The Saudi Arabian telecommunication satellite will deliver television, radio, Internet and mobile communications to customers in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. It will be located at one of Arabsat&aposs orbital positions and will support Arabsat&aposs competitive position as the first operator in the region for satellite capacities and services. In Falcon Heavy&aposs first launch last year, it carried a spacesuit-wearing mannequin, nicknamed Starman, seated in the driver&aposs seat of a red Roadster built by Musk&aposs car company, Tesla. It managed to land the two side boosters on Earth but the centre booster missed its mark and crashed into the ocean. It&aposs said there will be one more Falcon Heavy flight scheduled this year and it will be a mission for the United States Air Force carrying 25 small satellites. SpaceX has also announced contracts for two Falcon Heavy launches of commercial satellites, and the company has won two competitions to use the rocket for national security missions, reported the New York Times.",breaking spacex falcon heavy launch world powerful rocket takes second time,spacex successfully launched first commercial falcon heavy flight today megarocket equipped powerful booster launched communication satellite orbit nasa aposs kennedy space centre florida local time original launch scheduled wednesday cancelled due uncooperative weather fourteen months since maiden launch carried red tesla roadster time falcon heavy using upgraded block hardware gives per cent boost maximum thrust predecessor said company aposs ceo elon musk eighth minute launch falcon heavy aposs side booster accurately landed spacex landing zones cape canaveral far launchpad two minutes later core booster went higher farther set aposof course still love apos droneship atlantic ocean minute spacex announced successful deployment satellite meaning falcon heavy completed first commercial mission spacex livestreamed launch website crowds heard cheering witnessing event additional thrust claimed allow rocket propel pounds orbit nearly three times falcon lift saudi arabian telecommunication satellite deliver television radio internet mobile communications customers middle east africa europe located one arabsat aposs orbital positions support arabsat aposs competitive position first operator region satellite capacities services falcon heavy aposs first launch last year carried mannequin nicknamed starman seated driver aposs seat red roadster built musk aposs car company tesla managed land two side boosters earth centre booster missed mark crashed ocean aposs said one falcon heavy flight scheduled year mission united states air force carrying small satellites spacex also announced contracts two falcon heavy launches commercial satellites company two competitions use rocket national security missions reported new york times

The 23-storey-tall rocket, which previously launched Musk's cherry-red Tesla roadster to space in a 2018 debut test flight, blasted off from Florida's Kennedy Space Centre carrying its first customer payload — a communications satellite called Arabsat. ""T plus 33 seconds into flight, under the power of 5.1 million pounds of thrust, Falcon Heavy is headed to space,"" SpaceX launch commentator John Insprucker said on a livestream.  Roughly three minutes after clearing the launch pad, Falcon Heavy's two side boosters separated from the core rocket for a synchronised landing at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, just like it did for the rocket's debut last year. The middle booster, after pushing the payload into space, returned nearly 10 minutes later for a successful landing on SpaceX's seafaring drone ship waiting 645 kilometres off the Florida coast. In the 2018 test mission, Falcon Heavy's core booster missed the vessel and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. ""What an amazing day,"" a SpaceX flight commentator exclaimed. ""Three for three boosters today on Falcon Heavy, what an amazing accomplishment.""  Prime viewing spots were packed with tourists and locals eager to catch not just the launch but the rare and dramatic return of the twin boosters, accompanied by sonic booms. The roads were also jammed for Wednesday night's launch attempt, which was scuttled by high winds. Because this was an upgraded version of the rocket with unproven changes, SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk cautioned in advance that things might go wrong. But everything went exceedingly well, with SpaceX employees at company headquarters in Southern California cheering at every launch milestone, especially the three touchdowns. ""The Falcons have landed,"" Musk said in a tweet that included pictures of all three boosters.  Musk used his own Tesla convertible in last year's demo and the red Roadster — with a mannequin, dubbed Starman, likely still at the wheel — remains in a solar orbit stretching just past Mars. The Roadster is thought to be on the other side of the sun from us right now, about three-quarters of the way around its first solar orbit, said senior analyst at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, Jon Giorgini. A successful lift-off with Falcon Heavy's new military-certified Falcon 9 boosters was a crucial element in the race against Boeing-Lockheed venture United Launch Alliance and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin to secure lucrative military contracts. Musk's SpaceX, working to prove the flight-worthiness of its rocket fleet one mission at a time, aims to clinch one-third of all US National Security Space missions — coveted contracts that are worth billions of dollars. The US Air Force tapped SpaceX in 2018 to launch a classified military satellite, which cost it $US130 million ($182.3 million), and in February added three more missions in a $297 million contract. NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine last month suggested possibly using a Falcon Heavy — and another company's big rocket — to get the space agency's Orion capsule around the Moon in 2020, minus a crew.  Until SpaceX came along, rocket boosters were usually discarded in the ocean after satellite launches. However, with Musk's company intent on driving down launch costs by recycling rocket parts, the boosters for this flight may be re-used for future missions.

Among them, the electric-car maker is removing the $35,000 version of the car from its website. The most affordable ""Standard"" Model 3 can now only be ordered by phone, or in person at a Tesla store. The company cites customer demand for that change, saying the ""Standard Plus"" version of the Model 3 has sold at ""more than six times the rate of Standard."" The Model 3 Standard will be a ""software-limited"" version of the Standard Plus, with 10% less battery range than the Standard Plus. The Long Range rear-wheel drive Model 3 will also require a phone call or a visit to a Tesla store for customers who want it. That news follows Tesla's move in February to close some of its retail locations in order to shift sales online. The company had walked that announcement back a bit after it took some of its employees by surprise. In March, CEO Elon Musk sent an email to employees to clarify that strategy, saying its most popular stores would ""absolutely not be closed down,"" while lower-volume locations would ""gradually be closed down."" Read more: Tesla told some $35,000 Model 3 customers they were days away from getting their cars. Now, those customers don't know when their orders will arrive. Business Insider transportation reporter Mark Matousek tests Autopilot in a Tesla Model 3.
Mark Matousek / Business Insider In addition to the lineup changes, Tesla made Autopilot, its semi-autonomous-driving technology, a standard feature as part of an effort to make it less cost-prohibitive. ""For example, Model 3 Standard Plus used to cost $37,500, plus $3,000 for the Autopilot option. It now costs $39,500, with Autopilot included,"" Tesla said in a press release Thursday night. The company added: ""We think including Autopilot is very important because our data strongly indicates that the chance of an accident is much lower when Autopilot is enabled."" Tesla also highlighted what it says is positive customer feedback about the technology. Autopilot as a standard feature is not as robust as the optional full self-driving capability, which Tesla offers as a $5,000 option. With standard Autopilot, a Tesla vehicle can steer within its own lane in traffic, and accelerate and brake on its own. The full self-driving capability adds ""Navigate on Autopilot,"" which gives Teslas the ability to enter and exit freeways and merge onto freeway interchanges, and also drive around slower vehicles. The self-driving option includes automatic lane changes, auto-park, and the summon feature.

That's because Tesla plans to have those off-lease Model 3s join its self-driving ride-hailing fleet. In 2016, Tesla made known its intention to operate such a fleet, but did not mention at the time that previously leased Model 3s would be used for the program.

Tesla said that it would begin bundling its autopilot software as a standard feature on all cars, raising the base price, and would drop the entry-level Model 3 Standard from online ordering. As a result, the lowest-priced Model 3 available for order on its online menu in the United States is now the $39,500 Standard Plus, which includes Autopilot. The company in February had rolled out its long-awaited $35,000 version of the car with great fanfare. The company also said the Standard variant of Model 3 will now be a software-limited version of the Standard Plus, to simplify production.

As noted below, that information was not mentioned in its blog post on Thursday night. Original story: On Thursday night, Tesla announced some changes to its Model 3 range. The lineup has been simplified, the prices have been altered, and in the US it will now be possible to lease the car. First, Autopilot is now a mandatory option, although the company is only raising prices by $2,000 on each configuration instead of the $3,000 that customers have paid until this evening. Next, the Standard Range Model 3—the one with cloth seats that Elon Musk told us about as recently as February—is now gone. Instead, the cheapest Model 3 will be a software-locked version of the Standard Range Plus, which now costs $39,500. Its range drops from 240 miles (386km) to 216 miles (348km), and features like music streaming, navigation with live traffic, and heated seats will be disabled. Additionally, if you want one you have to call the company or visit one of the stores—there is no option to order it online. Tesla says that customers can pay to unlock the features of the Standard Range Plus at any time or choose to downgrade to the Standard Range and receive a refund for the difference in price. Since the Standard Range is not listed on the site, we can't confirm if the entry-level car now starts at $37,000 before any incentives at the time of writing. Assuming it is, the cost to unlock the extra 24 miles and those seat heaters should be $2,500. Further Reading
The Tesla Model 3, reviewed (finally)
The Long Range rear-wheel drive Model 3 has now also been dropped from online ordering. If you want one of these you'll also have to call or visit a store. However, you can still order a Long Range all-wheel drive Model 3 ($49,500 before incentives) and the Model 3 Performance ($59,500 before incentives). That means the most expensive Model 3 with Autopilot is now actually $1,500 cheaper than when we tested one a month ago; not a bad deal for a car that certainly impressed me. Finally, it will now be possible to lease a Model 3 instead of buying one—in the US, at least. All leases are for 36 months, with the option for 10,000, 12,000, or 15,000 miles a year (16,093km, 19,312km, 24,140km). The minimum lease deposit is $3,000 for all three Model 3s, although the amount due at signing varies depending on both spec and mileage; this ranges from $4,199 to $4,584. Monthly leasing payments decrease if a customer chooses to make a larger down-payment, but, if not, these range from $535 for the cheapest Standard Range Plus car to $889 for the Model 3 Performance.

The updated Falcon Heavy is now the world&aposs most powerful operation rocket with 27 engines firing at liftoff. It launched into the sky Thursday evening with Arabsat-6A, a Saudi Arabian satellite built by Lockheed Martin and operated by Saudi Arabia. Eight minutes after liftoff, SpaceX landed two of the first-stage boosters back at Cape Canaveral, side by side, just like it did for the rocket&aposs debut last year. The core booster landed two minutes later on an ocean platform hundreds of miles offshore -- the only part of the first mission that missed. SpaceX chief Elon Musk warned in advance things might go wrong, given the upgraded version of the rocket with unproven changes. But everything went exceedingly well and the satellite ended up in the proper orbit. SpaceX employees at company headquarters in Southern California cheered every launch milestone and especially the three touchdowns. ""The Falcons have landed,"" Musk said in a tweet that included pictures of all three boosters. NASA offered swift congratulations, tweeting: ""From our iconic launch pads at @NASAKennedy, we will continue to support the growing commercial space economy.” Musk put his own Tesla convertible on last year&aposs demo.

On top of that, it has made the Autopilot driver assist features standard on all its vehicles (except the aforementioned $35K model) and increased prices accordingly. The Model 3 Standard Plus, for instance, used to cost $37,500 plus $3,000 for Autopilot, and it now starts at $39,500. To make that easier to stomach, Tesla has also introduced leasing. US customers can choose from 10,000, 12,000 and 15,000 mile annual usage options, depending on their budgets and driving. Interestingly, Tesla said lease customers won't get the option to buy back their vehicles at the end of the term, because ""with full autonomy coming in the future via an over-their-air software update, we plan to use those vehicles in the Tesla ride-hailing network,"" Tesla wrote. Tesla is not only trying discourage customers from buying the base $35k Model 3, it wants to make it as easy as possible to upgrade. It will be software limited to a 220 mile range, and music streaming, navigation and heated seats will be software disabled. That means if customers change their minds, they can upgrade to a $39,500 Standard Plus model any time by paying the the difference and getting an over-the-air software update. Given the popularity of the Standard Plus relative to the Standard, we have made the decision to simplify our production operations to better optimize cost, minimize complexity and streamline operations. As a result, Model 3 Standard will now be a software-limited version of the Standard Plus, and we are taking it off the online ordering menu, which just means that to get it, customers will need to call us or visit any one of the several hundred Tesla stores. Deliveries of Model 3 Standard will begin this weekend. Tesla's long-range, rear-wheel drive Tesla Model 3 will also be unavailable to order online. ""We're making these changes to ensure that our online order process is focused exclusively on the three Model 3 variants customers want most,"" it said. CEO Elon Musk has said that Tesla would ""die"" by selling the cheapest Model 3 version too soon. The company seemed to pull that off through a series of cost-cutting measures, including closing stores and laying off employees. However, it quickly backtracked on closing the stores, electing to raise prices instead. Many customers said that their $35,000 Model 3 deliveries were delayed, and that Tesla tried to upsell them on pricier options.

With the 2019 New York Auto Show set to begin next week with media previews, car companies are looking for ways to stand out from the competition in an era when quality and reliability are similar across brands. “These things that a few years ago were expensive options on luxury cars are now safety features” across most line-ups, said Tom Mayor, a consultant at KPMG who advises car companies on their strategies. Completely driverless cars are more than 10 to 15 years out, he said. But here are six new technologies you can expect long before you can buy a self-driving car. Concerns about theft and a desire to offer more convenience have led automakers to pursue new ways to unlock and start vehicles. Wireless key fobs left in vehicles are making it easier for thieves to steal cars. Auto theft hit an eight-year high in 2017. At the New York Auto Show, Hyundai is introducing a ""Digital Key"" that allows vehicle owners to open and start their cars with their smartphones. Tax Day: Another tax headache ahead: IRS is changing paycheck withholdings, and it'll be a doozy Store closures: Fred's to close 159 stores and start clearance sales at 360 locations The system can be programmed to work with up to four phones. It will use near-field communication (NFC) technology to detect whether the approved phone is close to the vehicle's door. When it’s placed on a wireless charging pad in the center console, the driver can start and stop the car with a button. Hyundai is bringing the technology, previously available largely only on luxury brands like Tesla, to mainstream buyers of the redesigned 2020 Sonata, which will be unveiled at the New York. “If you are a tech-savvy user, you don’t really need to carry the fob,” said Manish Mahrotra, director of digital business planning and connected operations for Hyundai. “Your phone will do all the functions that your fob does today.” Hyundai is also developing a fingerprint-scanning system for starting a vehicle, but it has not announced plans to bring that technology to the U.S. Getting distracted behind the wheel? Had too many drinks and started driving anyway? Your car might soon be able to stop that risky behavior. Volvo announced in March that it “believes intoxication and distraction should be addressed by installing in-car cameras and other sensors that monitor the driver and allow the car to intervene.” The company is installing in-cabin cameras on all of its vehicles beginning “in the early 2020s.” It did not reveal details about where they would be positioned or how many there would be. But the Chinese-owned Swedish automaker said it “wants to start a conversation about whether car makers have the right or maybe even the obligation to install technology in cars that changes” driver behavior. General Motors already has in-car cameras installed in Cadillac cars equipped with an automated highway driving system called Super Cruise. The cameras monitor the driver’s eye movement to ensure they stay awake and keep their eyes on the road. If the cameras detect anything awry, they alert the driver to pay attention and can even bring the vehicle to a halt if the person doesn’t respond. Automakers are rapidly advancing augmented reality systems to help drivers keep their eyes on the road instead of looking away to get directions, for example. Some luxury models already have the capability to project the speed limit and other limited information onto a small windshield display for the driver to see. But engineers are going a step further. “We’re continuing to see a lot of focus on technologies that will reduce driver distraction,” Mayor said. “Picture a full-windshield heads-up display that can project the turn arrow actually onto the road in front of you or at least give you that perception with augmented reality.” For self-driving cars to become a reality, they must be able to create a continuously updating digital picture of the environment surrounding them. That requires advanced sensors and radar systems. Auto supplier Magna International is developing what it calls “Icon Radar,” which provides military-grade ability to distinguish between individual objects and enables driverless car technology. “The existing radar systems are analog,” said Swamy Kotagiri, Magna’s chief technology officer. “We looked into the future and said, 'We see a transformation just like ... in the cell phone industry where you went from analog to digital.” Kotagiri described the system as “imaging radar.” The company said it would be available beginning in 2019. “It’s a quantum jump in resolution, both in vertical and in longitudinal,” he said. “It has the capability to distinguish between two different objectives even though they’re very close to each other – for example, a pedestrian standing next to a stop sign.” Tesla’s introduction of a large touchscreen as a replacement for most physical controls in the vehicle has influenced competitors to move in a similar direction. Infotainment screens are bulking up. Some customers and safety watchdogs have complained that these screens are a safety risk because they lack the tactile feel of physical controls. But the recent arrival of more reliable voice-assistant technologies in the vehicle, such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and Apple Siri, will help alleviate some of the safety issues. Bigger infotainment screens are “where the market is going,” Mayor said. “It makes for easy over-the-air upgrades, (and) it lets consumers use their favorite apps in the vehicle.” Completely driverless cars that don’t need a safety driver and can operate in any environment are still a long way off. Perhaps decades, as Mayor suggested. But safety systems that assist the driver are becoming more common in mainstream models. Previously available largely on luxury cars, systems like lane-keeping assistance and automatic emergency braking are making their way into everyday models. In fact, automakers have pledged to make automatic emergency braking standard on all vehicles by September 2022.

Banks report: JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are set to report results before the opening bell. Revenue is expected to be flat at JPMorgan Chase in the first quarter and down at Wells Fargo. Bank stocks have struggled this year, so any indication of a recovery later this year will be welcomed. Shares in JPMorgan Chase have increased 8.8% this year, less than the broader market. Wells Fargo's stock has gained only 3.6%. Wells Fargo's business has been hurt by rising legal fees, a tarnished reputation and tough sanctions from federal regulators. One big question is whether it's any closer to naming a new CEO. 2. Uber IPO: Uber on Thursday filed paperwork for an IPO that is likely to be one of the biggest public offerings ever for a technology company. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi admitted to the company making ""missteps"" on its road to go public. The startup has faced a long list of scandals, including allegations of sexism and harassment. The transportation company lost $1.8 billion in 2018, an unprecedented sum for a company about to go public. Documents filed by Uber revealed that its revenue was up 42% in 2018 to $11.3 billion. In its fourth quarter, Uber had 3.9 million drivers on its platform and users took 1.5 billion trips. 3. Tesla announcements: Tesla (TSLA) has announced several changes to its model offerings and pricing. The carmaker said that all of its vehicles will now come with autopilot as standard. It said the feature would be included for less than the prior cost of the autopilot option. Tesla said it would stop selling its cheapest Model 3 online. It also said it would start leasing the Model 3, but the cars must be returned at the end of the lease for use in a Tesla ride-hailing network. The company endured a tough 2018 after months of manufacturing hangups and delays in rolling out the Model 3. It surprised investors by posting back-to-back quarterly profits at the end of last year. 4. Global market overview: US stock futures were pointing higher. European and Asian markets were mostly lower. The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.1% on Thursday. The S&P 500 closed flat and the Nasdaq ended down 0.2%.

I’ve figured out a way to get hold of some of that money, and maybe you’d like to join me. It involves industry disruption and crisis management, with my own soulless twist. This is high-tech stuff, so let me define a few technical terms. First, by unicorns, I’m talking about fantastic beasts: privately held companies worth at least a billion dollars. (Insert your joke here about who can catch a unicorn.) Unicorns like Lyft are sold to investors in initial public offerings of stock (also known as I.P.O.s), enabling insiders to make a ton of money. The precise terminology for these lucky people is “obscenely rich.” As always, I’ve been wondering: How can I become even naughtily rich? The trick is to find a business I can bootstrap to billions. Disrupting established industries seems to be the way to go: Even children know that Lyft and Uber have disrupted taxi service and Airbnb has disrupted hotels. Now it’s my turn to make a fortune. The crisis management business seems to be ripe for disruption. Crises are everywhere, especially in the business world. A company called Theranos failed so spectacularly that it has generated a best-selling book, an HBO documentary and a big podcast. Theranos claimed to have revolutionized blood tests. It has been a disaster, like the Fyre festival, but with pricked fingers. Then there’s Boeing, not to mention a number of current presidential campaigns. You get the idea. Crisis managers are already in great demand, but I intend to do something different: I’ll create crises, then solve them, leading to a staggeringly successful unicorn I.P.O. Lyft just had its I.P.O. and may soon be followed by some of the biggest names in tech, including Uber, Airbnb and Slack, the annoyingly ubiquitous program for sharing messages in the workplace. Exciting, right? Hope you like roller coasters: Lyft’s shares dropped below their offering price by their second day of trading, which means the stock price could use a … well, you know. The point with an I.P.O. is to be an insider, not a chump who gets fleeced by the insiders. Lyft’s founders, employees and early backers are getting quite a payday. Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm, comes away with about $900 million in instant profit. Carl C. Icahn apparently made about $550 million, according to The Wall Street Journal, by selling his stake to George Soros. That’s the life for me: mogul. I’ve been driving the same car for 10 years. It’s time to move up to something that extravagantly shows how much I love the planet. Not a mere Tesla, but the Jaguar electric E-Type Zero, which costs about $400,000. That kind of ride requires I.P.O. money. So, fellow insider, here’s my plan. I formulated it with invaluable help from Eric Dezenhall. He runs Dezenhall Resources, which, among other things, does crisis management. In an email, I told him that my life is an unmanaged crisis, so I need advice if I am to build a future in his field. His response was promising: “You do realize that the whole discipline is a farce, don’t you?” That convinced me that crisis management would be a good fit. He added: “All you need is a sport jacket and a cliché (such as ‘Get ahead of the story,’ a great-sounding phrase that has no meaning.)” This was getting better and better. As a veteran journalist, clichés are my métier. And, as it happens, I own a sport jacket. There are some moth holes, but I’ve gotten pretty good at using a felt-tip pen to match the jacket color with the lining. Mr. Dezenhall was impressed by my inventive use of the felt-tip pen. That, in itself, “is crisis management,” he said. But he cautioned that crisis management is no longer a matter of simply altering perceptions so that a bad situation looks like something good. “What people think we’re going to say is, ‘We didn’t dump PCBs in the river, we’re shampooing the fish!’ and people will say, ‘Ooh, that’s good,’” he said. But, no. That’s old thinking, he said. His trade has evolved. Instead of just changing perceptions, he said, the great crisis managers provide “operational solutions” that address root causes. That way, he said, a company can transcend the fickle and uncontrollable emotions that dominate the 24-hour news cycles and waves of Twitter outrage. So he would not, for example, advise the chief executive of Boeing to go on a televised apology tour for two recent crashes and the loss of hundreds of lives. (And, in fact, the company’s public response has been notably muted.) These days, he said, such gestures are instantly deemed inadequate. Instead, he said, it’s better to help companies actually fix their problems, which will do more to vindicate them than any snappy patter. That sounded hard. “What you’re saying,” I said, “sounds like it takes actual management ability.” I was beginning to despair. And that’s when the thunderbolt hit me: I could work the other side of the market. Crisis creation! I’d ferret out dire problems and make them much worse. Corporate executives already do that routinely, of course; I mean, just look at the series of apologies from Mark Zuckerberg over … well, almost everything. But hotshot executives have been calling those problems “mistakes.” I’d call them “my strategy.” Mr. Dezenhall ran with the idea: He said I could get paid by short sellers, or work directly with him to concoct scandals that expose companies to reputational crises, which he — and I — would be paid handsomely to relieve. Most of the time, we’d do nothing but wait for the situation to resolve itself and celebrate our success. Ideally, he said, we would cause problems that look like random events and that don’t besmirch the character of the company. He pointed to a spate of syringes found in Pepsi cans in the ’90s. (The Pepsi problem, which I covered a lifetime ago, earning mere workingman’s wages, turned out to be a hoax, with a splash of copycat effect.) Our corporate slogan would be this: Plant a problem, find the problem, claim to fix the problem. All in a profitable day’s work. “The future is in crisis creation!” he said. “I am happy to secretly finance this, and we’ll work together, and hopefully we’ll be on the Forbes 400 list in a few years.” It sounded exciting. It sounded like big money. Also, it sounded like he was joking. Unfortunately, he was. He turned out to be one of those people burdened with a sense of ethics and even a conscience. I need another partner. It could be you! This is a can’t-miss opportunity: We’ll capture a unicorn, throw it into crisis, and reap unfathomable rewards. It will definitely happen, though for now, I’ll keep my day job: describing crises without capitalizing on them. If I save my pennies, who knows? I might be able to get a new sport coat.",essay create crisis capture unicorn,unicorn season money gushing wall street figured way get hold money maybe like join involves industry disruption crisis management soulless twist stuff let define technical terms first unicorns talking fantastic beasts privately held companies worth least billion dollars insert joke catch unicorn unicorns like lyft sold investors initial public offerings stock also known enabling insiders make ton money precise terminology lucky people obscenely always wondering become even naughtily rich trick find business bootstrap billions disrupting established industries seems way go even children know lyft uber disrupted taxi service airbnb disrupted hotels turn make fortune crisis management business seems ripe disruption crises everywhere especially business world company called theranos failed spectacularly generated book hbo documentary big podcast theranos claimed revolutionized blood tests disaster like fyre festival pricked fingers boeing mention number current presidential campaigns get idea crisis managers already great demand intend something different create crises solve leading staggeringly successful unicorn lyft may soon followed biggest names tech including uber airbnb slack annoyingly ubiquitous program sharing messages workplace exciting right hope like roller coasters lyft shares dropped offering price second day trading means stock price could use well know point insider chump gets fleeced insiders lyft founders employees early backers getting quite payday andreessen horowitz venture capital firm comes away million instant profit carl icahn apparently made million according wall street journal selling stake george soros life mogul driving car years time move something extravagantly shows much love planet mere tesla jaguar electric zero costs kind ride requires money fellow insider plan formulated invaluable help eric dezenhall runs dezenhall resources among things crisis management email told life unmanaged crisis need advice build future field response promising realize whole discipline farce convinced crisis management would good fit added need sport jacket cliché get ahead story phrase meaning getting better better veteran journalist clichés métier happens sport jacket moth holes gotten pretty good using pen match jacket color lining dezenhall impressed inventive use pen crisis management said cautioned crisis management longer matter simply altering perceptions bad situation looks like something good people think going say dump pcbs river shampooing fish people say ooh good said old thinking said trade evolved instead changing perceptions said great crisis managers provide operational solutions address root causes way said company transcend fickle uncontrollable emotions dominate news cycles waves twitter outrage would example advise chief executive boeing go televised apology tour two recent crashes loss hundreds lives fact company public response notably muted days said gestures instantly deemed inadequate instead said better help companies actually fix problems vindicate snappy patter sounded hard saying said sounds like takes actual management beginning despair thunderbolt hit could work side market crisis creation ferret dire problems make much worse corporate executives already routinely course mean look series apologies mark zuckerberg well almost everything hotshot executives calling problems call dezenhall ran idea said could get paid short sellers work directly concoct scandals expose companies reputational crises would paid handsomely relieve time nothing wait situation resolve celebrate success ideally said would cause problems look like random events besmirch character company pointed spate syringes found pepsi cans pepsi problem covered lifetime ago earning mere workingman wages turned hoax splash copycat effect corporate slogan would plant problem find problem claim fix problem profitable day work future crisis creation said happy secretly finance work together hopefully forbes list sounded exciting sounded like big money also sounded like joking unfortunately turned one people burdened sense ethics even conscience need another partner could opportunity capture unicorn throw crisis reap unfathomable rewards definitely happen though keep day job describing crises without capitalizing save pennies knows might able get new sport coat

It has also introduced leasing and made Autopilot standard.
Tesla's $35,000 Model 3 is only available as a special order  Tesla has halted online sales of the $35,000 Model 3 and will only sell it by telephone or in its stores. It also made the Autopilot driver-assist features standard on all its vehicles (except the aforementioned $35K model) and increased prices accordingly. The Model 3 Standard Plus, for instance, used to cost $37,500 plus $3,000 for Autopilot, and it now starts at $39,500.
Intriguingly, Tesla has also introduced leasing. US customers can choose from 10,000, 12,000 and 15,000 mile annual-usage options. Lease customers won't get the option to buy back their vehicles at the end of the term, with the company planning to use those older vehicles in its autonomously driven ride-hailing network.

Alienware Area-51m review: A gaming desktop stuffed inside a laptop  Alienware's Area 51m is a truly unique laptop. It's portable, but it packs all the power and customizability you'd want from a gaming desktop. Still, when other modern laptops are significantly thinner, cheaper and almost as powerful, it's a tough sell for most gamers. If anything, it's a testament to Dell's ingenuity.

The Netflix-fighter is coming.  After more than a year of waiting, Disney took the wraps off of its subscription streaming service Thursday night in a presentation for investors. Disney+ will launch November 12th across most mobile and connected TV platforms, ready to draw in streamers with day-one content including Captain Marvel, all 30 seasons of The Simpsons, Pixar movies, a new Star Wars live-action series called The Mandalorian and even Disney's impressive library of animated movies. While we saw some of the apps in action, we didn't get much in the way of tech details beyond confirmation it supports 4K and HDR. Disney promised more than 25 original episodic series, more than ten original movies, more than 7,500 episodes of old shows, more than 100 recent titles and more than 400 archive titles, all in year one alone. Still, the biggest news is the price: It all costs $6.99 per month or $69.99 annually. SpaceX launched its rocket after a delay due to inclement weather.

The automaker announced late Thursday that it would begin leasing the Model 3 ""for a small down payment and competitive monthly payments."" It's not the same as a standard auto industry lease, which typically gives leasees the option to purchase the vehicle when the lease expires. ""Please note, customers who choose leasing over owning will not have the option to purchase their car at the end of the lease, because with full autonomy coming in the future via an over-the-air software update, we plan to use those vehicles in the Tesla ride-hailing network,"" Tesla said in a blog post. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long teased the possibility of a ride-hailing network of Tesla vehicles, but the company has not announced details. Tesla Model 3 leases will be available with mileage limits of 10,000, 12,000 or 15,000. The move could help boost sales of the Model 3 at a time when investors are worried about long-term demand for the car. Luxury car customers choose leasing over buying more than 50 percent of the time, according to Evercore ISI. What it's like to own one: Has this Model 3 owner's yearning been fulfilled? Model Y unveiled: Tesla CEO Elon Musk says electric SUV 'will ride like a sports car' Meanwhile, the company is removing the $35,000 version of the Model 3 from online-only ordering. The base version became available for sale about six weeks ago after years of anticipation, with Musk billing the vehicle as an affordable electric car for the masses. The company said customers will need to visit a Tesla store or call Tesla to order the $35,000 model, dubbed Standard, which won't have heated seats, music streaming service and other features. Customers can pay at any time to upgrade to the next step up, called Standard Plus, and activate those features. Standard Plus now begins at $39,500, with the company's partially self-driving Autopilot system included, instead of $37,500 plus a $3,000 upgrade for Autopilot. The company said it's making the moves because ""we have made the decision to simplify our production operations to better optimize cost, minimize complexity and streamline operations.""

Chief executive Elon Musk has long touted the standard Model 3 as a watershed for the electric car industry that will bring the technology to the mass market. But the company has struggled to figure out a way to sell it at that price and actually makes a profit. Customers who want the $35,000 Model 3 cans till get one but they will have to go into a Tesla showroom or make the purchase over the phone. The latest announcement is the fourth round of changes to Tesla’s pricing and retail strategy, which has appeared increasingly erratic. Mr Musk’s company had said it would shut almost all of its showrooms to focus on online sales before an about turn just 10 days later in which it said most locations would stay open but prices would rise. Now the focus has switched again. As part of the changes,customers will be able to lease a Tesla for the first time but with a big caveat: they don’t get the option of buying the car once their lease is up. Why? Because Tesla wants to use them in its planned ride-hailing network which it hopes will take on the likes of Uber and Lyft. All Tesla vehicles now come with the Autopilot driver-assistance system as standard, the company said in a blog post.

It's also making it harder for customers to buy its cheapest model. The company did not provide any specific reason for the changes announced on Friday, but it endured a tough 2018 after months of manufacturing hangups and delays in rolling out its best-selling Model 3. Last week it reported a 31% fall in deliveries in the first three months of 2019 compared to the previous quarter, the single largest drop ever. Even with the price hikes, drivers may actually be getting a better deal than before. Its Model 3 Standard Plus previously cost $37,500, plus $3,000 for autopilot. It will now sell for $39,500 including the assisted driving function. It offers drivers basic self-driving features. It can assist motorists in changing lanes, parking and exiting freeways. ""Autopilot is very important because our data strongly indicates that the chance of an accident is much lower when autopilot is enabled,"" the company said in a statement. ""Autopilot also dramatically improves the quality of the driving experience, especially in heavy traffic, as thousands of our customers frequently describe online,"" it added. More changes for the Model 3 The company is also making it harder for customers to buy the most basic version of the Model 3, which sells for $35,000 and doesn't come with autopilot. The vehicle will no longer be sold online — customers will have to call or visit a Tesla service center to order one. The Model 3 Standard and the Model 3 Plus are essentially the same vehicle. To give an advantage to customers willing to pay more for the Standard Plus, Tesla downgrades the abilities of the Model 3 standard, limiting the miles it can travel on a single charge, blocking some autopilot features and preventing drivers from turning on the seat warmers. CEO Elon Musk had long promised a $35,000 version of the Model 3 but it only went on sale at the end of February. Musk said at the time that the company will have to close stores and lay off workers in order to sustain production of the cheaper car. He later backed off the store closure plans. From Friday, customers will have the option of leasing, rather than buying, the Model 3. For a small down payment and a monthly fee, customers can choose any version of the car and select from a range of annual mileage options. They'll have to hand the cars back when the lease ends so Tesla can use them in its planned driverless ride-hailing network.

Now, in the latest course correction, Tesla says it will end online sales of the long-awaited $35,000 version of its Model 3 sedan, its lowest-priced offering, and make other changes that will effectively raise the price of the car for many customers. The move comes just over a month after Tesla announced that the $35,000 version was finally coming to market. “The constant shifting of pricing and options is really confusing and frustrating for customers,” Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst, said Friday. “People buy a car for one price, and a few weeks later it’s selling for a different price.” In a blog post late Thursday, Tesla said customers wanting the $35,000 version of the Model 3 would have to make the purchase by phone or in person at one of its stores. [Read more: One reporter’s quest to see if Tesla’s new policy made things unnecessarily complicated.] The cheapest Model 3s ordered online will now include Tesla’s Autopilot driver-assistance system and a longer battery range, features that increase the price to $39,500. The blog post said Tesla was making the changes to “simplify vehicle choices and to make Autopilot more affordable.” Such a configuration would previously have cost $40,500, it said. A Tesla spokesman said the change would allow the company to produce one version of the Model 3 and use software to limit the battery range and turn off features such as heated seats for customers who wanted the $35,000 model. A longer range and additional features will be switched on in the $39,500 car, known as the Standard Plus model. Previously, Tesla planned to put a smaller battery pack in the basic model and a larger one in the Standard Plus, the spokesman said. Tesla’s announcement also said it would begin leasing the Model 3, but would not offer customers the option to buy the cars after their leases expired, a departure from the typical industry practice and its own policy on other models. Tesla said it aimed to upgrade Model 3s returned after a lease to allow them to drive themselves, with no human at the wheel, and be deployed in a driverless taxi fleet. The company acknowledged that the technology for driverless taxis was still in development and would need to be approved by safety regulators before such a business could begin. The latest moves coincide with a slump in Tesla’s sales, especially in the United States. In the first quarter, the company delivered about 63,000 cars, a 31 percent drop from the fourth quarter. Elon Musk, the company’s chief executive, has also said Tesla has experienced delays and difficulties starting up deliveries of the Model 3 in Europe and China, and will report a loss in the first quarter after producing profits in the final two quarters of 2018. Tesla has forecast 2019 deliveries of 360,000 to 400,000 cars, but after the weak showing in the first quarter, it will have to deliver an average of about 100,000 cars in the final three quarters to reach that range. Domestic demand is likely to be tempered further after July 1, when the federal tax credit available to Tesla customers falls to $1,875 from the current $3,750. “We think TSLA will be hard pressed to hit the guidance” on deliveries, Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA Research, wrote in a note to investors Thursday. New areas of concern have emerged, too. Tesla’s battery partner, Panasonic, said this week that it was “watching the demand situation” and studying whether to go ahead with further investments in the battery plant, known as the Gigafactory, that the two companies operate in Nevada. The statement was a response to a report by the Japanese news organization Nikkei that Panasonic was freezing its investments in the plant. The company recently ousted the executive who had engineered the partnership with Tesla. In its own statement, Tesla said it and Panasonic “continue to invest substantial funds” in the Nevada plant, but were now focusing more on increasing production without adding new equipment. “We are seeing significant gains from upgrading existing lines to increase output,” Tesla said. A prominent skeptic on Wall Street, David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, who has long bet against Tesla’s shares, cited the report about the Gigafactory, along with the recent sales figures and accounts of quality problems, as evidence that “the wheels are falling off.” The $35,000 version of the Model 3 has long been seen as a potential gateway to the mass market. As recently as January, Mr. Musk estimated that global demand for the Model 3 would reach 700,000 to 800,000 cars a year “in a strong economy.” He originally began extolling the $35,000 model in 2016. On Feb. 28, in announcing that it was finally becoming available, Mr. Musk said Tesla would close most of its stores and showrooms to cut costs in hopes of producing the low-priced version at a profit, while increasing its emphasis on online sales. Less than two weeks later, the company retreated, saying it would keep many stores and showrooms open. Tesla’s shares finished slightly lower on Friday, and are down 16 percent since their close on Feb. 28.",tesla ends online sales model creating new hurdle buyers,faced slumping sales increasing financial stresses tesla shifted course several times last two months deciding keep stores saying would close cutting prices raising latest course correction tesla says end online sales version model sedan offering make changes effectively raise price car many customers move comes month tesla announced version finally coming market constant shifting pricing options really confusing frustrating customers mike ramsey gartner analyst said friday people buy car one price weeks later selling different blog post late thursday tesla said customers wanting version model would make purchase phone person one stores read one reporter quest see tesla new policy made things unnecessarily complicated cheapest model ordered online include tesla autopilot system longer battery range features increase price blog post said tesla making changes simplify vehicle choices make autopilot configuration would previously cost said tesla spokesman said change would allow company produce one version model use software limit battery range turn features heated seats customers wanted model longer range additional features switched car known standard plus model previously tesla planned put smaller battery pack basic model larger one standard plus spokesman said tesla announcement also said would begin leasing model would offer customers option buy cars leases expired departure typical industry practice policy models tesla said aimed upgrade model returned lease allow drive human wheel deployed driverless taxi fleet company acknowledged technology driverless taxis still development would need approved safety regulators business could begin latest moves coincide slump tesla sales especially united states first quarter company delivered cars percent drop fourth quarter elon musk company chief executive also said tesla experienced delays difficulties starting deliveries model europe china report loss first quarter producing profits final two quarters tesla forecast deliveries cars weak showing first quarter deliver average cars final three quarters reach range domestic demand likely tempered july federal tax credit available tesla customers falls current think tsla hard pressed hit guidance deliveries garrett nelson analyst cfra research wrote note investors thursday new areas concern emerged tesla battery partner panasonic said week watching demand situation studying whether go ahead investments battery plant known gigafactory two companies operate nevada statement response report japanese news organization nikkei panasonic freezing investments plant company recently ousted executive engineered partnership tesla statement tesla said panasonic continue invest substantial funds nevada plant focusing increasing production without adding new equipment seeing significant gains upgrading existing lines increase output tesla said prominent skeptic wall street david einhorn greenlight capital long bet tesla shares cited report gigafactory along recent sales figures accounts quality problems evidence wheels falling version model long seen potential gateway mass market recently january musk estimated global demand model would reach cars year strong originally began extolling model announcing finally becoming available musk said tesla would close stores showrooms cut costs hopes producing version profit increasing emphasis online sales less two weeks later company retreated saying would keep many stores showrooms open tesla shares finished slightly lower friday percent since close

The letter highlights eight positions — five long positions and three shorts — that are driving the fund's performance this year, including a short on Tesla. Safety concerns about Tesla cars, in which ""the wheels are falling off — literally,"" according to the letter, is only part of the reason the company ""appears to again be on the brink."" ""The signs are everywhere, from the lack of demand, desperate price cutting, layoffs, closing-and-then-not-closing stores, closing service centers, cutting capex, rushed product announcements and a new effort to distract investors from the demand problem with hyperbole over TSLA's autonomous driving capabilities,"" the letter states.

See more: Tesla's senior director of global security has left the company — here are all the key names who have departed in recent months Greenlight declined to comment beyond the letter. Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The letter goes on to state that Tesla CEO Elon Musk ""never admits crisis in real time,"" and has promised previously that the company would be profitable without delivering. Einhorn, in a presentation last year to partners, called Tesla a cult. The letter also cites its long positions in companies like General Motors and Brighthouse Financial as a reason for the early success this year — two companies that attributed to a hellacious 2018 for the fund, when it lost 34%.

And despite the constructive criticism, Buffett, who has been been CEO of Berkshire Hathaway for nearly 50 years, did admit that the tech billionaire is ""a remarkable guy."" But Buffett seems to think Musk, who has been CEO of Tesla for a little over a decade, would benefit from being more selective about what he posts on Twitter. ""It's just, some people have a talent for interesting quotes and others have a little bit more of a blocker up there that says 'this could get me into problems,'"" Buffett says in the Yahoo Finance interview. ""I just don't see the necessity to communicate [on Twitter],"" Buffett adds. Of course, Buffett is far from a prolific tweeter himself. ""I don't even know how to do it,"" he says in the interview. Buffett doesn't write his own tweets and despite boasting over 1.5 million followers, has nine posts total since his handle launched in April 2013.  ""I just think there's other things in life I want to do than tweet. I am not that desperate for somebody to hear my opinion,"" Buffett previously told CNBC. By comparison, Musk's Twitter account has 25.7 million followers and the Tesla CEO has tweeted more than 7,200 times since joining the site in June 2009. The question about Musk, and Buffett's candid response, come at a time when Musk faces ongoing criticism over his propensity to make controversial statements on Twitter. Musk was recently in federal court facing contempt charges after the Security and Exchange Commission said the Tesla CEO violated the terms of an October 2018 securities fraud settlement stemming from a Musk tweet last August about taking Tesla private.

""The wheels are falling off — literally,"" Einhorn, founder and president of Greenlight Capital, said in an investor letter seen by CNBC. Einhorn's public bet against Tesla added to the fund's 11 percent gain in the first quarter. The 50-year-old investor slammed Tesla's safety protocols and cars with faulty suspensions, ""such that the wheels sometimes fall off (referred to as 'whompy wheels')."" He cited an incident in February when a man in Florida was killed in his Model S after hitting a tree. ""TSLA routinely touts its cars as the safest around, because they perform well in crash tests. The truth is, its overall safety is much lower because of events like this,"" he said, adding that the fatality rate for Tesla drivers is much higher than it is for other luxury cars. The billionaire has been vocal about his Tesla short — likening it to Lehman Brothers, the investment bank that Einhorn famously bet against months before it declared bankruptcy and triggered the worst of the financial crisis. CNBC has reached out to Tesla for comment. Among Einhorn's other reasons to bet against Tesla: Lack of demand, ""desperate price-cutting,"" closing-and-then-not-closing stores, closing service centers, cutting capex, layoffs, ""rushed product announcements,"" and a ""new effort to distract investors from the demand problem with hyperbole over Tesla's autonomous driving capabilities."" Einhorn also took on Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who he said, ""never admits the crisis in real time."" ""The company appears to again be on the brink,"" he said. ""The signs are everywhere."" Last year, the Tesla short was a drag on the fund's performance. Greenlight had its worst year on record while Tesla rallied roughly 7 percent. This year though, Tesla shares are on a different trajectory. The stock is down roughly 20 percent since the start of 2019. Einhorn said Tesla was ""notably absent"" from a consortium of automakers to establish safety rules for development, testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles. The automaker ""continues to use its customers and other motorists, bikers, and pedestrians sharing the road with distracted or sleeping Tesla drivers as guinea pigs,"" he said.  — CNBC's Leslie Picker contributed reporting.",hedge fund manager david einhorn slams tesla wheels falling,hedge fund manager david einhorn taking digs tesla wheels falling literally einhorn founder president greenlight capital said investor letter seen cnbc einhorn public bet tesla added fund percent gain first quarter investor slammed tesla safety protocols cars faulty suspensions wheels sometimes fall referred wheels cited incident february man florida killed model hitting tree tsla routinely touts cars safest around perform well crash tests truth overall safety much lower events like said adding fatality rate tesla drivers much higher luxury cars billionaire vocal tesla short likening lehman brothers investment bank einhorn famously bet months declared bankruptcy triggered worst financial crisis cnbc reached tesla comment among einhorn reasons bet tesla lack demand desperate stores closing service centers cutting capex layoffs rushed product announcements new effort distract investors demand problem hyperbole tesla autonomous driving capabilities einhorn also took tesla ceo elon musk said never admits crisis real time company appears brink said signs everywhere last year tesla short drag fund performance greenlight worst year record tesla rallied roughly percent year though tesla shares different trajectory stock roughly percent since start einhorn said tesla notably absent consortium automakers establish safety rules development testing deployment autonomous vehicles automaker continues use customers motorists bikers pedestrians sharing road distracted sleeping tesla drivers guinea pigs said cnbc leslie picker contributed reporting

They're ideal if you have minimal storage space and don't want to deal with the hassle of storing gasoline and oil. Electric mowers tend to weigh much less than their gas-powered counterparts, so they can be easier to transport and use. One huge advantage, though, is their push-button start. The fact that I wouldn't have to deal with a pull-cord, an engine that is reluctant to turn over, or gas that had simply gone bad was one of the driving factors behind my first electric mower purchase. I have nerve damage in both hands, so a lightweight mower that was easy to start turned out to be the perfect solution for my small yard. And unlike gas-powered lawn mowers, the electric variants are quieter and do not pollute. The mowers in this list come in battery-powered or corded design. The corded mowers are really suitable for smaller yards because you will need to use an extension cord to run the mower. Learning to mow a pattern so that you don't run over (and cut) your cord takes a bit of practice, but is also doable. The battery-powered models are a bit more versatile, though you'll find that battery life varies. If you have a large yard or an incline, keeping two sets of batteries charged and ready may be necessary if you want to mow the entire space in one session. Keep in mind that electric mowers may not be as powerful as gas versions, and the cut quality may be inconsistent We included the electric lawn mowers below based on a number of factors, including versatility, power, battery life, features, and overall performance. They're available at a variety of price points, so you should be able to find something that works for your budget and needs.",best electric lawn mowers buy,electric lawn mowers practical alternative gas mowers many reasons ideal minimal storage space want deal hassle storing gasoline oil electric mowers tend weigh much less counterparts easier transport use one huge advantage though start fact would deal engine reluctant turn gas simply gone bad one driving factors behind first electric mower purchase nerve damage hands lightweight mower easy start turned perfect solution small yard unlike lawn mowers electric variants quieter pollute mowers list come corded design corded mowers really suitable smaller yards need use extension cord run mower learning mow pattern run cut cord takes bit practice also doable models bit versatile though find battery life varies large yard incline keeping two sets batteries charged ready may necessary want mow entire space one session keep mind electric mowers may powerful gas versions cut quality may inconsistent included electric lawn mowers based number factors including versatility power battery life features overall performance available variety price points able find something works budget needs

Tesla wants to fulfill CEO Elon Musk's long-running promise of a $35,000 car, which he first promised in 2013. It will deliver the first $35,000 version of its Model 3 this weekend. But Tesla doesn't intend to sell many of that version. Six times as many buyers are willing to upgrade their Model 3s than buy the base version, Tesla says. If customers pay $4,500 more than the lowest sticker price, they'll get autopilot features, a slightly longer range on a single charge, as well as some creature comforts, like seat warmers. Tesla announced Thursday that it would no longer sell the $35,000 version online. Every other Tesla can be purchased that way. Customers who want a Tesla at rock bottom price will have to order it by phone or go into a service center or one of its shrinking number of stores. That means many Tesla customers may not even be aware that a $35,000 version is available. ""They're still offering it for the PR value of saying they have a $35,000 car,"" said Kelsey Mays, senior consumer affairs editor of Cars.com. ""It is a little bait and switch, but it's certainly not unprecedented for an automaker to do that."" A $35,000 Tesla has become the latest of Musk's grand promises that the company has struggled to meet. When Musk announced in February that Tesla would finally start making a $35,000 version of the Model 3, he also warned that the company would probably lose money in the first quarter (Tesla will report results on April 24). It demonstrates the difficulty of making money while selling cutting-edge cars at mass-market prices. ""I would guess that Elon Musk saw a point in time years ago where he could sell a $35,000 car and make money on it,"" said Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Cox Automotive. ""So he committed to that number. Now they can technically say they have done it. But they realize it's not a good business model. They're probably losing money on each $35,000 car."" Tesla has not commented on the profitability of its different models, But it will make more money on what it calls the Standard Plus, which will start at $39,500. That's because the $35,000 Model 3 Standard and Standard Plus are essentially the same car. Tesla downgrades the abilities of the Model 3 Standard version, limiting the miles it can travel on a single charge, blocking some autopilot features and preventing drivers from turning on the seat warmers. ""Making different versions of the same car costs money because it slows down production,"" said Brauer. ""So they've crunched the numbers and decided it's better to make the same car for both the $35,000 version and the $39,500 version."" The more expensive version is still a mass market car. The average transaction price of a new car purchase in the United States is just less than $36,000 according to Kelley Blue Book. ""You can buy a Ford F-150 or a Honda Pilot for far more than $40,000, and they're not luxury models,"" said Brauer. The fact that Tesla is essentially selling the Model 3 with a $39,500 starting price, by making it more difficult to buy one at the long-promised $35,000 price, probably won't hurt the company in the eyes of its customers. ""Tesla shoppers are not bargain hunters. They're early adopters of technology. And they're buying a brand with a premium reputation,"" said Mays.

But There Are a Few Things to Know.,"When Tesla said on Thursday night that the most basic, $35,000 version of its Model 3 would no longer be offered online, my colleagues and I were confused. Isn’t a Silicon Valley company supposed to be all about the internet? Why do I need to use a phone or, worse, go to one of Tesla’s showrooms and interact with a sales representative in real life to order a high-tech car? I wanted to try the process for myself to see if Tesla’s new policy made things unnecessarily complicated. Though I stopped short of placing an order, it turned out to be quite easy to walk through the purchase process for a Model 3, both online and over the phone. Despite some conflicting information, my phone conversations with people at three Tesla stores in the New York area about buying a Model 3 were efficient and matter-of-fact. Online, it took me less than two minutes to select a car and reach the credit card information page. But you can’t necessarily get the version you’re after, even from a store. And I did learn a few things any potential Tesla buyer should know. Now that Tesla isn’t selling the bare-bones Model 3 online, the least expensive car you can buy on its website goes for $39,500.

But Tesla lists the car’s price as $28,950. That figure is later described as “after savings,” and the company even displays the per-month cost of a lease in those terms. As it turns out, Tesla is using some creative math to get to that number. Savings include a $3,750 tax credit currently available to Tesla buyers, but they also include money that you would otherwise spend on gas if you bought a standard car. Using a tool on the Tesla site, you can adjust that figure by changing the number of miles per month you might drive or the cost of gasoline.

The company explains what it’s doing, but this still struck me as a questionable sales tactic, especially since the price “after savings” is the first price you see on the website. For buyers looking for the $35,000 base model of the Model 3, the only way to get one without trekking to a store is to make a phone call. When it announced the sales change, Tesla said the “standard” Model 3 was actually a software-limited version of the more expensive car you can buy online. That means the range of the car on a full charge is restricted, for example, not by battery physics but by software that aims to keep it that way. A Tesla sales representative on Long Island explained this, too, and said a buyer could pay the difference for a more capable version at a later date and the car would be updated over the airwaves. For me, the biggest point of confusion had to do with test drives. Tesla says on its website that you can drive a car for a week, or less than 1,000 miles, and still return it. A sales representative in Westchester County repeated this. He also said that if I did a test drive before buying I’d have only one day to return the car, so I reasoned it was probably better to buy first, drive later. What I was told, however, conflicted with the policy as Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, recently stated it on Twitter: that returns were possible within one week regardless of a test drive. A Tesla spokeswoman said this was a recent change. Word may not have reached all the stores. Another point on which the stores seem out of step with the company’s party line is in estimating the time it would take to get a car. According to the website, a car should be available in two weeks, but the Westchester store said it might take up to four, especially if I really wanted a less-expensive version of the Model 3. The store in Manhattan said I couldn’t get a $35,000 Model 3 there at all. The cheapest version it had available would cost $45,500.",buying tesla seems pretty easy things know,tesla said thursday night basic version model would longer offered online colleagues confused silicon valley company supposed internet need use phone worse go one tesla showrooms interact sales representative real life order car wanted try process see tesla new policy made things unnecessarily complicated though stopped short placing order turned quite easy walk purchase process model online phone despite conflicting information phone conversations people three tesla stores new york area buying model efficient online took less two minutes select car reach credit card information page necessarily get version even store learn things potential tesla buyer know tesla selling model online least expensive car buy website goes tesla lists car price figure later described savings company even displays cost lease terms turns tesla using creative math get number savings include tax credit currently available tesla buyers also include money would otherwise spend gas bought standard car using tool tesla site adjust figure changing number miles per month might drive cost gasoline company explains still struck questionable sales tactic especially since price savings first price see website buyers looking base model model way get one without trekking store make phone call announced sales change tesla said standard model actually version expensive car buy online means range car full charge restricted example battery physics software aims keep way tesla sales representative long island explained said buyer could pay difference capable version later date car would updated airwaves biggest point confusion test drives tesla says website drive car week less miles still return sales representative westchester county repeated also said test drive buying one day return car reasoned probably better buy first drive later told however conflicted policy elon musk tesla chief executive recently stated twitter returns possible within one week regardless test drive tesla spokeswoman said recent change word may reached stores another point stores seem step company party line estimating time would take get car according website car available two weeks westchester store said might take four especially really wanted version model store manhattan said get model cheapest version available would cost

President Donald Trump has spoken out about it. Lawmakers are debating ways to stop the flow of money and data between the two. The adversary in this cross-border drama is China, which has raised alarm bells in the US as it bulks up its homegrown tech industry and arouses suspicion of spying and influence. However, there's much less fuss about the cozy ties between another repressive foreign power and Silicon Valley. Saudi Arabia's presence in Silicon Valley is greater than it's ever been. That became especially clear on Thursday when Uber filed its IPO paperwork. We learned from the S-1 filing that the kingdom's Public Investment Fund owns 5.2% of the ride-sharing company. The figure might actually under-count Saudi Arabia's influence within Uber. Softbank, the Japanese tech conglomerate, owns a 16.3% stake in Uber through its Softbank Vision Fund. The biggest investor in the Vision Fund is Saudi Arabia, which contributed $45 billion of the fund's massive $100 billion bankroll. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Softbank's Masayoshi Son
Reuters The Vision Fund is Silicon Valley's undisputed kingmaker today, writing big checks and amassing stakes in high-flying startups such as WeWork, Slack, DoorDash and GM Cruise. That means Saudi cash is essentially funding much of Silicon Valley's innovation. As the New York Times pointed out in October, this gusher of Saudi money is an inconvenient truth for an industry that prides itself on making the world a better place. Some basic facts about Saudi Arabia: It's a place where torture and arbitrary arrests are widespread, according to Amnesty International; a place where women are not allowed to travel abroad without the permission of a male ""guardian."" It's the leader of a coalition blamed for airstrikes in Yemen responsible for thousands of civilian deaths and injuries. And then there's the gruesome killing of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashogghi, which, according to the CIA's initial conclusion, was ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the Wall Street Journal reported. In other words, Saudi Arabia is antithetical to everything tech companies' altruistic mission statements claim to stand for. Saudi money may be more prevalent in tech now, but it's not new. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal was an early investor in Twitter, and at one point owned a stake larger than cofounder Jack Dorsey's. (Alwaleed was himself detained — in a Ritz Cartlon hotel — for three months in 2017 by his cousin Prince Mohammed, the current leader of the country). And the Saudi Public Investment Fund is also a shareholder in Magic Leap, Tesla and Virgin Galactic, according to research firm CB Insights. Whether you're in augmented reality or outer space, there's no escaping Saudi money. A 2018 Quartz article cites an estimate by research firm Quid that Saudi investors directly participated in tech investment rounds totalling at least $6.2 billion during the previous five years. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi
Fortune Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi backed out of a conference organized by Prince Mohammed last year after the Khashogghi killing, as did now-former Google Cloud CEO Diane Greene. But for the most part, there's been little pushback among tech startups when it comes to accepting Saudi or Softbank money. So why is Silicon Valley okay with Saudi money? It's true that we live in a world that runs on oil — so drawing a moral line isn't easy when you're pumping gas into your car every day. Maybe the tech industry thinks it's bringing the winds of change. After all, when Uber announced its Saudi investment in 2016, women weren't allowed to drive. ""Of course we think women should be allowed to drive,"" Uber's Jill Hazelbaker told the New York Times at the time. ""In the absence of that, we have been able to provide extraordinary mobility that didn't exist before — and we're incredibly proud of that."" And two years later, change did happen when the ban on women driving was officially lifted. Did Uber's presence in Saudi Arabia cause the change? It's impossible to say with certainty, but I'd wager not. Much more likely is that Prince Mohammed, looking for a way to burnish his credentials as a ""reformer"" when he rose to power in 2017, saw the controversial driving ban as an easy and expedient thing to jettison in exchange for goodwill. The notion of working from the inside to bring about change has a long and not-so-great track record in tech. Think back to Google contorting itself into a pretzel to justify its introduction, and then withdrawal, of a search engine in China. When outrage recently erupted over Google's secret plans to make a new censored search app for China, the company didn't even try to justify itself with a ""change from within"" argument. You may ask, at this point, why more companies don't take a stand and turn down Saudi cash. The sad reality is that companies are more interested in preserving the status quo that their businesses are built on than in bringing about change; even the ""disruptive"" tech companies. That's especially true today, as tech companies are under siege from all sides, blamed for disrupting our privacy, our elections and our children's attention spans. U.S. President Donald Trump (C) and other leaders react to a wall of computer screens coming online as they tour the Global Center for Combatting Extremist Ideology in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia
Reuters/Jonathan Ernst Thinking differently is great marketing copy when it sells gadgets. But there's little upside in leading a revolution if it scares away customers. Look no further than Google's app store. Thanks to an app called Absher, Saudi men can direct where women travel, and receive alerts when women use a passport to leave Saudi Arabia. After Insider's Bill Bostock investigation into this wife-tracking app, US lawmakers demanded that Google remove Absher from its app store. Google refused to pull the app. It argued that the app does not violate its terms of service. Right now, the tech industry's terms of service are clear.

Clever anti-alcohol interlocks on cars are already able to override a vehicle to stop a driver who has failed a breathalyser from taking the wheel - but technology is set to go even further. Tesla boss Elon Musk claims the driverless cars he is developing will be so safe that drivers will be able to sleep at the wheel while their vehicle navigates autonomously. But the next frontier for &apossmart&apos driving tech could go much further. An expert is predicting authorities will in the future able to hijack tomorrow&aposs cars remotely - even while you&aposre still at the steering wheel - to slow down speedy drivers. Experts at a US tech firm have reportedly told a conference at an Artificial Intelligence (AI) event in San Francisco how police could soon be able to take control of speeding cars. Qualcomm&aposs Nakul Duggal predicts the smart cars of the future will become so cleverly interconnected that cars will be able to be linked into roadside infrastructure that can talk to speed-limiting systems, the Sun reports. The company is reportedly already working with top car makers to provide technology to connect future smart cars to one another. Duggal explained an advanced speed-control system could theoretically work by installing the necessary technology into roadside infrastructure, such as street lights. A combination of cameras and radar installed every kilometre could be used to track cars&apos progression. The roadside sensors could catch out rogue drivers captured driving too fast or making illegal lane changes, Duggal reportedly explained. That information could then be automatically registered with police databases, and ultimately could see authorities being able to tap into smart cars to slow them down. The expert explained the backbone for such technology already exists. The Sun reports Duggal explained how the ability already exists for AI technology to communicate to a vehicle what actions to take. “So if there’s a speed limit requirement due to congestion, this is something that can be managed through infrastructure,” he said. Authorities could even get the tools to halt you driving completely, if they are able to discern you are unfit to be behind he wheel, he continued. “Driver monitoring…is useful from a safety perspective,” Nakul reportedly said. “The alertness of the driver is critical. Is the driver impaired? Is the driver in the best health? “If not, the car will be able to drive itself and take it to a safe area where it doesn’t impact other cars.” He told reporters an AI system could take the roadside technology  and cross-check it it against GPS. If there is no coverage in the area, the roadside tech captures and car&aposs inbuilt location systems could be used to pinpoint its location is down to 10cm of accuracy.

Heard describes a number of incidents when Depp alleged beat and choked her while he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol during their four-year relationship in the complaint obtained by The New York Post on Thursday. Depp sued Heard last month over a 2018 op-ed she wrote for the Washington Post in which she described being a victim of domestic abuse but did not mention the actor, whom she divorced after 15 months of marriage in May 2016. Happy and healthy: The actress looked happy and healthy as she got closer to her director boyfriend before heading out for the day Beginnings: They were first seen together in mid-March when they were photographed sharing a kiss The defamation suit accused Heard of implying that Depp was abusive toward her and labeled her claims 'an elaborate hoax'. Heard responded to Depp's suit by laying out the actor's alleged abuse in vivid detail. She claims that her then-husband became 'a totally different person, often delusional and violent' when he was abusing drugs and alcohol. 'We called that version of Johnny, ""the Monster"",' she wrote. High profile: The filmmaker is the latest high-profile man to step out with Heard who has also dated Tesla founder Elon Musk Exes: Heard was famously married to actor Johnny Depp from 2015 to 2017 whom she had met on the set of their movie Rum Diary She said she first witnessed his alleged substance abuse about a year into their relationship, which began in 2012. 'On some occasions, when Johnny simultaneously used both illegal narcotics and prescription medications I have had to get him medical attention,' she wrote, according to The Post. 'Whenever he was using, I worried for both of us.' Paling around: Later on she was seen at Mantee Cafe with a male friend Keeping consistent: She donned the same look as before Addressing Depp's repeated denials of her allegations, Heard wrote: 'Johnny often would not remember his delusional and violent conduct after he came out of his drunk or medicated states.' She added: 'Because I loved Johnny, I had believed his multiple promises that he could and would get better. I was wrong.' Heard has renewed her allegations of domestic abuse against Depp in a new court filing in response to his $50million defamation lawsuit. The couple, who divorced in May 2016 after 15 months of marriage, are seen above in January 2016 Heard claims in the filing that Depp became 'a totally different person' when he was abusing drugs and alcohol. The actress is pictured on Sunday in Los Angeles Heard specifically describes one morning in May 2014 when she and a visibly intoxicated Depp clutching a bottle of champagne boarded a private jet from Boston to Los Angeles. She said that once they were on the flight, Depp ordered the flight attendants to give him an oxygen tank and continued to drink heavily. 'Johnny's handlers told me that he was upset that I was filming a movie with a romantic scene with James Franco the day before,' wrote Heard, who was filming The Adderall Diaries with Franco at the time. 'Soon, Johnny began to throw objects at me. Instead of reacting to his behavior, I simply moved seats. That didn't stop him. He provocatively pushed a chair at me as I walked by, yelled at me, and taunted me by yelling out the name ""James Franco"".' She continued: 'At some point, I stood up, and Johnny kicked me in the back, causing me to fall over. Johnny threw his boot at me while I was on the ground. 'Johnny continued to scream obscenities until he went into the plane bathroom and passed out locked in the bathroom for the remainder of the flight.' Heard claimed that Depp later apologized to her over text message, writing: 'Once again, I find myself in a place of shame and regret. Of course, I am sorry. I really don’t know why or what happened. But I will never do it again. 'My illness somehow crept up and grabbed me … I must get better . . . Again, I am so sorry, so sorry. … I love you and I feel so bad for letting you down.' Heard also claimed that Depp’s assistant Stephen Deuters messaged her and claimed that the actor didn't remember what he'd done, saying he was 'appalled' when he learned about the incident. Deuters allegedly said: 'When I told him he kicked you, he cried. He’s a little lost boy. And needs all the help he can get.' Heard and Depp began dating in early 2012 and were married in February 2015. The actress filed for divorce 15 months later in May 2016. The couple are pictured together in May 2014 The next fight described by Heard via The Post took place over three days in March 2015, just one month after Heard and Depp tied the knot. Heard claims that Depp was supposed to be clean when he went on a three-day ecstasy bender in Australia. He later said that he didn't believe he broke his sobriety because his new wife hadn't 'explicitly forbidden' him from taking ecstasy. 'The argument heated up, and Johnny pushed me, slapped me, and shoved me to the ground before I retreated to a locked bedroom,' Heard wrote. The following morning Heard allegedly found that her new husband hadn't slept at all because he'd taken 'about eight MDMA pills' and was drinking again. 'We got into a fight that Johnny made physical, and I barricaded myself in one of the rooms. That didn’t stop Johnny from busting through the door of the room I was in.' 'By nightfall, Johnny had hit me multiple times, shoved and pushed me to the ground, choked me, and spit in my face. 'Johnny then handed me a liquor bottle that he was drinking from, and asked me: ""What are you going to do?"" I threw the bottle on the floor. Johnny responded by starting to throw cans and unopened glass bottles at me.' After Heard filed for divorce images emerged at the time (above) showing her with a bruised eye and face Heard continued: 'That night, Johnny shoved me into a ping pong table that collapsed underneath me. Johnny threw bottles through the window panels of a glass door, breaking two panes, and leaving glass everywhere. 'Johnny then grabbed me, gripping my body and nightgown. He tore the nightgown off, and at some point, I was naked and barefoot, covered in alcohol and glass. 'Johnny grabbed me by my hair and choked me against the refrigerator in the kitchen. I tried to stand myself up but I was sliding around the glass-strewn floor and countertop. Johnny threw me away from him, and I tried to run away as Johnny continued to throw objects and alcohol at me. 'In one of the most horrific and scariest moments of this three-day ordeal, Johnny grabbed me by the neck and collarbone and slammed me against the countertop. I struggled to stand up as he strangled me, but my arms and feet kept slipping and sliding on to the spilled alcohol and were dragged against the broken glass on the countertop and floor, which repeatedly slashed my feet and arms. Scared for my life, I told Johnny: ""You are hurting me and cutting me."" 'Johnny ignored me, continuing to hit me with the back of one closed hand, and slamming a hard plastic phone against a wall with his other until it was smashed into smithereens. While he was smashing the phone, Johnny severely injured his finger, cutting off the tip of it. Once I was able to get away, I barricaded myself in an upstairs bedroom. The next morning, which marked the third day Depp had gone without sleep, Heard stated: 'I came downstairs to find numerous messages Johnny had written to me around the house, on the walls and on my clothes, written in a combination of oil paint and the blood from his broken and severed finger. Johnny also urinated all over the house.' Heard said Depp was hospitalized after the incident and she walked away with 'a busted lip, a swollen nose, and cuts all over my body'. She said many of those scars still haven't healed four years later. Heard said she hit back at Depp during another incident in March 2015 that was witnessed by her younger sister Whitney at his home in Los Angeles. She said Depp had been destroying all of her personal property throughout the house when he suddenly 'lunged' at her and Whitney stepped in between them. 'Johnny turned his attention to Whitney, who was standing on the top of a flight of stairs, and moved on her,' Heard stated. 'Acting in defense of my sister, as I was scared for her physical safety, I punched Johnny in the face to draw his attention away from her. That was the only time I ever hit Johnny.' Depp has long denied the allegations and has instead claimed that his ex-wife repeatedly violently attacked and severely injured him. The pair are seen together in October 2015 'The Monster' reared his ugly head again in August 2015 when the couple were traveling through Thailand and Malaysia and Depp allegedly chocked Heard for so long that she thought he might kill her. Then in December of that year, Depp 'picked a fight' with Heard and began destroying their Los Angeles apartment before he dragged her across the house. 'In the process, he pulled large chunks of hair and scalp out of my head,' the filing claims. Describing what transpired next, Heard wrote: 'Hoping to avoid the violence, I tried to calm Johnny down, and then went upstairs to try to remove myself from the situation. Johnny followed me, hit me in the back of my head, grabbed me by my hair again, got in front of me on the steps, and then dragged me by my hair up the last few steps. 'At the top of stairs, Johnny shoved me twice, which made me fear I would fall. I told Johnny that he had broken my wrist in an attempt to get him to stop. 'Johnny kept hitting me, and each time he knocked me down, I chose to react by simply standing up and looking him in the eye. Johnny responded by yelling: ""Oh, you think you’re a f***ing tough guy?"" The Eastern Columbia Building in downtown Los Angeles where Johnny Depp is reported to have paid $2million for a penthouse apartment is pictured above 'He reeled back and head-butted me in my face, bashing my nose, which immediately began bleeding, sending searing pain through my face. I instantly started tearing up, and I thought that I would have to go to the hospital. 'I told Johnny I wanted to leave him, and that I would call the police if he ever touched me again. When I began to walk away toward the guest apartment, he responded by pushing me, then grabbed me and pulled me from one room to the next, gripping me by my hair. 'By the time Johnny had dragged me into the upstairs office, I told Johnny that I was leaving him, since I could not put up with his behavior any longer. Johnny reacted by grabbing me by my throat, pushing me down to the ground, and punching me in the back of my head. He grabbed me by my hair, slapping me in the face, and screaming at me something like: ""I f***ing will kill you — I'll f***ing kill you, you hear me?"" There were chunks of my hair everywhere and indentations in the carpet where I was dragged. Heard said the fight continued on a bed, where Depp 'got on top of me with his knee on my back and the other foot on the bedframe, while repeatedly punching me in my head, and he screamed—as loudly as I’ve ever heard him scream— ""I f***ing hate you"" over and over again. 'The bedframe splintered under the weight of the pressure of his boot. Johnny hit me with his closed fists, and I remember being unable to hear myself screaming because he had pushed my face into the mattress. I screamed as loudly as I could, hoping Johnny would realize he was severely hurting me. 'For a while, I could not scream or breathe. I worried that Johnny was in a blacked-out state and unaware of the damage he was doing, and that he could actually kill me.' It wasn't until several months later in May 2016 that Heard finally decided to end the relationship for good after he grabbed her phone and 'wound up like a baseball pitcher and threw the phone in my face, as hard as he could'. Heard said she screamed and cried as Depp continued to attack her before a neighbor heard the commotion and intervened. She also filed for a restraining order from Depp at the same time as the divorce. Heard was spotted leaving a California court in 2016 with facial bruising (above) after she was granted a temporary restraining order against Depp just days after claiming he attacked her In the latest filing Heard also addressed rumors that she faked her injuries, writing: 'Many people called me a liar (without ever hearing my story). I was dropped from a global fashion brand’s upcoming campaign. I lost a part for a movie in which I had already been cast. People I have never met or spoken to threatened me with violence. I received so many death threats I had to change my phone number on a near-weekly basis. 'People accused me of having abused Johnny. That simply is not true. I never attacked Johnny other than in self-defense (and in defense of my little sister). I have never physically abused anyone. I know what that does to people.' She continued: 'Instead, I have attempted to promote good in the world and to advocate an end to domestic violence. I have sought to use my public persona to speak out on an issue that was extremely meaningful to me and millions of other women and men every year. 'I have spoken out about violence in public, but I have always avoided specifically referencing Johnny, or recounting his violence against me, not only because I wanted to move past that phase of my life but also because I was constrained by the terms of a strict confidentiality agreement that Johnny had insisted upon as part of our divorce settlement.' DailyMail.com has reached out to Heard's attorney for comment. Depp has long denied the allegations and has instead claimed that his ex-wife repeatedly violently attacked and severely injured him. In the defamation lawsuit, Depp claims Heard threw a glass vodka bottle at him and caused the bones in the tip of his right middle finger to shatter. He claims the incident occurred one month into their marriage and resulted in him having to have his finger 'surgically reattached'. 'Ms Heard then disseminated false accounts of this incident, casting Mr Depp as the perpetrator of his own injury'. Depp claims in the lawsuit that he was dropped from Pirates of the Caribbean just four days after Heard's op-ed was published in the Washington Post. 'Ms Heard also knew that her elaborate hoax worked: as a result of her false allegations against Mr Depp, Ms Heard became a darling of the #MeToo movement, was the first actress named a Human Rights Champion of the United Nations Human Rights Office, was appointed ambassador on women’s rights at the American Civil Liberties Union, and was hired by L’Oreal Paris as its global spokesperson.'",amber

Communist leaders are shifting the burden to automakers by imposing mandatory sales targets for electrics, adding to financial pressure on them amid a painful sales slump. Chinese purchases of pure-electric and hybrid sedans and SUVs soared 60% last year to 1.3 million — half the global total — but overall auto sales shrank 4.1% to 23.7 million. Buyers of electrics were lured with subsidies of up to 50,000 yuan ($7,400) per car, but that support was cut by half in January and ends next year. “Competition is getting more fierce,” said industry analyst Paul Gong of UBS. Communist leaders have been promoting electrics for 15 years in hopes of cleaning smog-choked Chinese cities and gaining an early lead in a promising industry. General Motors, Volkswagen, Nissan and other global majors are developing models to suit Chinese tastes. They have money and technology, but local rivals have experience: brands including BYD Auto and BAIC Group have been selling low-priced electrics for a decade. At the Shanghai show, which opens to the public Saturday, automakers plan to display dozens of electrics, from luxury SUVs to micro-compacts priced under $10,000. They aim to compete with gasoline-powered models on performance, cost and looks. By the end of next year, “it will be very difficult for a customer to decide against an electric car,” said the CEO of Volkswagen AG, Herbert Diess. “The cars will offer roominess, space, fast charging,” Diess said during a January visit to Beijing. “They will look exciting.” Automakers are looking to China, their biggest global market, to drive revenue growth at a time when U.S. and European demand is flat or declining. That gives them an incentive to cooperate with Beijing’s campaign to promote electrics. This week, General Motors Co. is unveiling the first all-electric model in Buick’s China-only Velite range, which includes a hybrid based on the Chevrolet Volt. VW will display a concept SUV as part of plans to launch 50 electric models by 2025. Nissan Motor Co. and its Chinese partner will display the Sylphy Zero Emission, an all-electric model designed for China that went on sale in August. BYD Auto will display an all-electric sedan with an advertised range of 400 kilometers (250 miles) on one charge. Pressure to shift to electrics is “more an opportunity than a threat” to Chinese automakers, said UBS’s Gong. Latecomers to gasoline-powered vehicles, Chinese brands account for just 10% of global sales, mostly in low price tiers, Gong said. But they account for 50% of electric sales worldwide. “In the EV world, Chinese companies started earlier and reacted faster,” said Gong. The ruling Communist Party has spent billions of dollars on research grants and incentives to buyers. State-owned power companies have blanketed China with 730,000 charging stations, a vastly larger network than any other country. Meanwhile, automakers are struggling to revive sales of traditional SUVS, minivans and sedans that fell last year for the first time in three decades. A tariff war with Washington and weakening economic growth made jittery consumers reluctant to commit to big purchases. That skid worsened this year. First-quarter sales shrank 13.7% from a year earlier. Despite that, people in the industry say Chinese sales could top 30 million vehicles a year by 2025. Ford relaunched its China operation this year after 2018 sales plunged 37%. The company blamed an aging product lineup. Global brands are linking up with Chinese partners with experience at low-cost production. Ford has an electric venture with Zotye Auto. GM and its Chinese partners plan 10 electric models by next year. Mercedes Benz launched the Denza brand with BYD. VW’s electric joint venture, SOL, started selling an SUV last year. Under the new system, automakers must earn credits for sales of electrics equal to at least 10% of purchases this year and 12% in 2020. Automakers that fall short can buy credits from competitors that exceed their targets. Regulators say targets will rise later. An electric’s sticker price in China still is higher than a gasoline model. But charging and maintenance cost less. Industry analysts say owners who drive at least 16,000 kilometers (10,000 miles) a year save money in the long run. China’s biggest SUV brand, Great Wall Motors, has responded to the sale quotas by launching an electric brand, Ola. Its R1 compact, while looks like a toy beside Great Wall’s hulking SUVs, went on sale in December priced as low as 59,800 yuan ($8,950) after the subsidy. In a move to spur competition, Beijing lifted ownership restrictions on electric automakers last year. Tesla Ltd. responded by announcing plans to build its first factory outside the United States in Shanghai. Official ambitions clash with the Chinese public’s love of bulky SUVs, seen as the safest option on crowded, bumpy streets. But sentiments are shifting. A UBS survey found 71% of Chinese buyers are willing to try an electric, up from 58% a year ago. The rate for the United States and Europe was below 20%. “Customer willingness is always higher in China,” said Gong.",china auto show highlights electric ambitions,beijing ap year shanghai auto show highlights global industry race make electric cars chinese drivers want buy beijing winds subsidies promoted sales communist leaders shifting burden automakers imposing mandatory sales targets electrics adding financial pressure amid painful sales slump chinese purchases hybrid sedans suvs soared last year million half global total overall auto sales shrank million buyers electrics lured subsidies yuan per car support cut half january ends next year competition getting fierce said industry analyst paul gong ubs communist leaders promoting electrics years hopes cleaning chinese cities gaining early lead promising industry general motors volkswagen nissan global majors developing models suit chinese tastes money technology local rivals experience brands including byd auto baic group selling electrics decade shanghai show opens public saturday automakers plan display dozens electrics luxury suvs priced aim compete models performance cost looks end next year difficult customer decide electric car said ceo volkswagen ag herbert diess cars offer roominess space fast charging diess said january visit beijing look automakers looking china biggest global market drive revenue growth time european demand flat declining gives incentive cooperate beijing campaign promote electrics week general motors unveiling first model buick velite range includes hybrid based chevrolet volt vw display concept suv part plans launch electric models nissan motor chinese partner display sylphy zero emission model designed china went sale august byd auto display sedan advertised range kilometers miles one charge pressure shift electrics opportunity threat chinese automakers said ubs gong latecomers vehicles chinese brands account global sales mostly low price tiers gong said account electric sales worldwide ev world chinese companies started earlier reacted faster said gong ruling communist party spent billions dollars research grants incentives buyers power companies blanketed china charging stations vastly larger network country meanwhile automakers struggling revive sales traditional suvs minivans sedans fell last year first time three decades tariff war washington weakening economic growth made jittery consumers reluctant commit big purchases skid worsened year sales shrank year earlier despite people industry say chinese sales could top million vehicles year ford relaunched china operation year sales plunged company blamed aging product lineup global brands linking chinese partners experience production ford electric venture zotye auto gm chinese partners plan electric models next year mercedes benz launched denza brand byd vw electric joint venture sol started selling suv last year new system automakers must earn credits sales electrics equal least purchases year automakers fall short buy credits competitors exceed targets regulators say targets rise later electric sticker price china still higher gasoline model charging maintenance cost less industry analysts say owners drive least kilometers miles year save money long run china biggest suv brand great wall motors responded sale quotas launching electric brand ola compact looks like toy beside great wall hulking suvs went sale december priced low yuan subsidy move spur competition beijing lifted ownership restrictions electric automakers last year tesla responded announcing plans build first factory outside united states shanghai official ambitions clash chinese public love bulky suvs seen safest option crowded bumpy streets sentiments shifting ubs survey found chinese buyers willing try electric year ago rate united states europe customer willingness always higher china said gong

(AP) — A Hot Springs Village couple will conclude 17 years of Tesla Coil creations and donations to science museums with their 10th coil donation to the Greensboro Science Center in Greensboro, N.C., in late June. In an effort to inspire, educate and entertain the public about Nikola Tesla, Richard Mathias and his wife, Mary Ellen, have donated the museum-quality Tesla Coil exhibits to science museums around the nation since 2002. The donations began when he constructed and donated a 1.5 million volt Tesla Coil to Hot Springs’ Mid-America Science Museum in 2002. After receiving a grant from General Electric to fund half his efforts, Mathias was able to fund the remaining half, leading to the exhibit that would be known as “Caged Lightning.” “Caged Lightning” sits in its own theater at Mid-America today, surrounded by a 2.5-ton steel cage designed by the museum’s director of design, Niles Ellis. Each presentation of the exhibit provides a demonstration of the Tesla Coil, a look into Nikola Tesla’s life and an explanation of how the invention contributes to everyday life, The Sentinel-Record reported. It has received approximately 3 million visitors. In 2007, the coil was certified as the World’s Most Powerful Conical Coil on Earth by Guinness World Records. From this point on, General Electric assisted in the partial funding of all the Tesla Coils Mathias created and donated to science museums. Mathias went on to construct and donate two more Guinness World Record setting Tesla Coils. The World’s Most Powerful Bi-polar Musical Tesla Coil was donated to Hands On! Regional Museum in Johnson City, Tenn., in 2014, and the World’s Largest Bi-Polar Musical Tesla Coil was donated to Museum of Discovery in Little Rock in 2015. Other museums Mathias has donated coils to include Discovery Museum in Texarkana, Texas, Insight Museum in El Paso, Texas, Arizona Science Center in Phoenix, KidSenses Children Interactive Museum in Rutherfordton, N.C., and Discovery Place in Charlotte, N.C. After the first installation of a Tesla Coil at Mid-America, Mathias and his wife created a smaller, 400,000-volt Tesla Coil and began a traveling educational program titled “Sermon from Science.” The program, lasting from 2003-2009, traveled to 40 schools and civic organizations, reaching over 22,000 students. In 2017, the coil was donated to the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe in Shoreham, N.Y. — the site where Tesla’s laboratory once sat. As the end of his donations near, Mathias said it was time to conclude his series of Tesla Coil creations because of both his and his wife’s age and the funding from General Electric had declined immensely from the initial amount. “We’ve come to realize there is a time and a season for everything, and our season is over with. It’s time to turn it over to the younger generation now,” Mary Ellen Mathias said. Nikola Tesla was an inventor from the late 1800s to the early 1900s, responsible for inventing the first alternating current motor and developing AC generation and transmission technology, according to History.com. Among his inventions, Tesla created the Tesla Coil — a resonant transformer circuit producing electricity. According to Mid-America Science Museum, the Tesla Coil consists of two coils wound in a different manner than that of a traditional transformer, utilizing an air-core design rather than an iron-core design. The primary coil resonates with the secondary coil because they are tuned to be in step with each other electrically. This is accomplished by adjusting the number of turns in the primary coil winding and the total capacitance in the capacitor bank. Mathias was first introduced to the Tesla Coil when he was 9, visiting the Griffith Park Observatory in Southern California. He was so enamored with the invention from that point on, he went on to pursue a career in electrical engineering. He worked for Westinghouse Electric and General Electric before retiring and moving to Hot Springs Village with his wife, beginning a new adventure creating Tesla Coils. Mathias said he wants the Tesla Coil Museum Exhibit Program to provide people with an interest in technology and science, along with an understanding of Tesla and his inventions. ___ Information from: The Sentinel-Record, http://www.hotsr.com",hot springs village pair cap years tesla coil gifts,hot springs ark ap hot springs village couple conclude years tesla coil creations donations science museums coil donation greensboro science center greensboro late june effort inspire educate entertain public nikola tesla richard mathias wife mary ellen donated tesla coil exhibits science museums around nation since donations began constructed donated million volt tesla coil hot springs science museum receiving grant general electric fund half efforts mathias able fund remaining half leading exhibit would known caged caged lightning sits theater today surrounded steel cage designed museum director design niles ellis presentation exhibit provides demonstration tesla coil look nikola tesla life explanation invention contributes everyday life reported received approximately million visitors coil certified world powerful conical coil earth guinness world records point general electric assisted partial funding tesla coils mathias created donated science museums mathias went construct donate two guinness world record setting tesla coils world powerful musical tesla coil donated hands regional museum johnson city world largest musical tesla coil donated museum discovery little rock museums mathias donated coils include discovery museum texarkana texas insight museum el paso texas arizona science center phoenix kidsenses children interactive museum rutherfordton discovery place charlotte first installation tesla coil mathias wife created smaller tesla coil began traveling educational program titled sermon program lasting traveled schools civic organizations reaching students coil donated tesla science center wardenclyffe shoreham site tesla laboratory sat end donations near mathias said time conclude series tesla coil creations wife age funding general electric declined immensely initial amount come realize time season everything season time turn younger generation mary ellen mathias said nikola tesla inventor late early responsible inventing first alternating current motor developing ac generation transmission technology according among inventions tesla created tesla coil resonant transformer circuit producing electricity according science museum tesla coil consists two coils wound different manner traditional transformer utilizing design rather design primary coil resonates secondary coil tuned step electrically accomplished adjusting number turns primary coil winding total capacitance capacitor bank mathias first introduced tesla coil visiting griffith park observatory southern california enamored invention point went pursue career electrical engineering worked westinghouse electric general electric retiring moving hot springs village wife beginning new adventure creating tesla coils mathias said wants tesla coil museum exhibit program provide people interest technology science along understanding tesla inventions information http

(AP) — For a suburban Minnesota police department, the idea of an electric police car is so far-fetched it was the punchline of an April Fools’ Day prank on social media. In a tweet, a Coon Rapids police officer proudly showed off his department’s new Tesla before confessing it was all a prank. While electric police cars are being tested in cities around the country (the image in the tweet was a Model S being used by the Los Angeles Police Department), the Coon Rapids Police Department will continue using gasoline-powered cars for now. The city may buy an electric vehicle within the next year, though it’s unlikely to be a Tesla due to its high price. A Tesla “is not even a thought right now, it’s not even a consideration,” said Andy Kintop, Coon Rapids’ recycling and sustainability specialist. ___ The nonprofit news outlet Energy News Network provided this article to The Associated Press through a collaboration with Institute for Nonprofit News. ___ Barriers to faster electric vehicle adoption include a higher initial cost compared to conventional gas-powered models, and the lack of an infrastructure required to charge them, Kintop said. But he’s still an optimist who believes the city’s fleet will turn electric “faster than people think.” Kintop has been among the more than two dozen city officials who for the past year have shared information on how to transition their fleets to electric vehicles and build a charging infrastructure in their communities. Cities Charging Ahead, a project of the Great Plains Institute and Clean Energy Resource Teams, wraps up this summer after holding several meetings around the state. Most of the participants in the program have had their vehicle fleets analyzed and in a few cases they have purchased a sedan or two, said Diana McKeown of Clean Energy Resource Teams, or CERTs. They have studied locations where installing chargers makes the most sense. However, progress remains slow in many communities. “It’s so new there’s only a handful of cities doing this stuff and the examples are small and few,” she said. City officials involved in the program generally embrace the idea of electric vehicle fleets, she said, but they understand changing over a fleet takes political will, investment and collaboration with private entities. Transitioning city fleets to electric vehicles begins with an assessment, which provides data on the total cost of vehicle ownership, identifies new fleet compositions and provides a multi-year program for replacing gas with electric vehicles. Utilities have been more than willing to pay for the assessments, which cost more than $10,000. Xcel Energy, a partner in the project, agreed to pay for several fleet studies that have been done by FleetCarma. Connexus Energy did the same for Coon Rapids. David Wanberg, the city planner for Faribault, Minnesota, said the FleetCarma data showed the city could eventually replace 20 gas vehicles with electric versions and save money, a big selling point to city council members. “Based on the information we have, we’ve made some plans on how we want to move ahead with electric vehicles,” he said. A handful of cities and their municipally owned utilities have started small and purchased or leased electric vehicles. Tom Sagstetter, conservation and key accounts manager for Elk River Municipal Utilities, said the city chose to lease a plug-in Mitsubishi Outlander because city officials were concerned that technology advances would improve electric vehicles well beyond what is available today. A shorter-term lease guards against that problem, he said. The utility, in contrast, purchased a Chevy Bolt that has been driven by Sagstetter, who generally travels short distances for much of his work. His former vehicle, a Ford Explorer, has now been assigned to a meter reader. A persistent barrier to city and community adoption remains the lack of charging stations. But many city employees have jobs where the range of typical electric vehicles will never be reached. Michael Keim, Bloomington’s fleet manager, said the city plans to buy two electric vehicles for employees who conduct inspections. “Those vehicles will have plenty of range for the footprint we have here,” he said. Fears expressed by Bloomington’s staff about electric vehicles and hybrids have been eased through information sharing by Keim. Employees told him the interiors of the city-owned hybrids they drove took a long time to warm up in Minnesota’s frigid winters. Having purchased his own electric last year, Keim found the opposite — it warms faster than gasoline or hybrid vehicles. A major obstacle to having an electric fleet has been cost, even though studies show the vehicles are less pricey to operate over time due to less maintenance and lower fuel costs. The state of Minnesota has a purchasing contract for electric vehicles that Keim used to get good prices on Bloomington’s two vehicles. The state contract, however, does not always lower the cost enough. Coon Rapids had a budget of $26,000 for an all-wheel-drive SUV for its engineering department. The state contract for a comparable electric hybrid vehicle, the Mitsubishi Outlander, came in at around $30,000. “You had to figure out how to get that five grand down to fit it into the top of the budget,” Kintop said. The city bought Chevy Traverse instead. Cities Charging Ahead participants also shared information on charging stations in their communities. A handful have chargers they own on city property or least have one or two operated by private entities. Funding remains difficult but city officials have begun applying for money from the VW settlement, a strategy Faribault has taken in conjunction with a local business located near an interstate highway, Wanberg. Red Wing used a CERTs grant and funding from the city’s sustainability commission to place a DC fast charger on Highway 61. Several local businesses are paying for the electricity and have window stickers on the charging station advertising their stores. Other funding sources are emerging. Xcel Energy committed $25 million to building out a charging infrastructure. Municipal and cooperative electric utilities are also working with businesses on financing and installing chargers. The location of chargers is another issue for cities. Edina, a Minneapolis suburb, found all the city’s electric car chargers located in Southdale, an area filled by shopping centers and apartment complexes. The 16-square-mile city now plans to add at least one public charger over the next few years to each of its other three quadrants, said Tara Brown, sustainability manager. Edina installed its first city-owned public charger last year in a parking garage serving the regional shopping area 50th and France, she said. Residents will be asked to suggest future locations. “You have to look at where people are congregating,” she said. “We know the infrastructure has to be there throughout the city to reduce range anxiety.” The issue of serving city fleets with chargers presents another challenge. Keim points out the electric panel available for chargers at Bloomington’s government complex are limited. The city’s fleet has 600 vehicles, so moving even a small percentage of them to electricity will test its infrastructure. “Once we have 30 or 40 cars, that will require a lot of amperage,” he said. “Developing a charging infrastructure will be our biggest challenge.”",electrifying city fleets improbable think,coon rapids ap suburban minnesota police department idea electric police car punchline

Why it matters: Though the report's accuracy is questioned, it's still closely watched. Economists expect the Chinese economy to have expanded 6.3% on an annual basis, slower than the 6.4% in the prior quarter. On the earnings front, look for an update on Netflix's cash burn on Tuesday. Multinational conglomerate Honeywell reports on Thursday: Its earnings generally give a good indication of the health of the market as a whole. It's a shortened week for many traders, as markets around the world — including the U.S., London and even Hong Kong — are closed for Good Friday.
Per Reuters, this week marks ""the first of four consecutive shortened trading weeks,"" where at least one major exchange is closed for one day. 2 big tech IPOs are coming this week: Pinterest and Zoom. Thought bubble by Axios' Dan Primack: Pinterest is consumer-focused and unprofitable. There's also not anything else quite like it, and you can see an actual path to profitability.
Zoom is enterprise-focused, profitable and likely to be valued 7 times above its last private round. It plays in a mature videoconferencing space, but seems to do it better than its legacy peers. Apple and Tesla will be in court this week. Apple's ongoing licensing fight with Qualcomm will head to another federal court starting this week. Jury selection begins in San Diego tomorrow.

But with that consideration comes questions about the future of electric vehicles in the province — and the infrastructure to support them. That includes everything from charging options to whether BC Hydro can handle the demand for extra electricity that more e-vehicles will bring. Hydro predicts there will be at least 300,000 fully electric cars on the roads by 2030. ""It's something that we have been planning for in terms of our load forecast,"" said Mora Scott, a spokesperson for BC Hydro. ""We are continuing to expand our system but we do have more than enough power for this."" Battery range, charging questions As for concerns around the range of electric vehicles and charging them, B.C. already boasts more than a thousand public charging stations, from Tofino to the Alberta border. Scott told CBC'sThe Early Edition that BC Hydro also has 58 fast-charging systems across the province — which will charge a car's battery to 80 per cent capacity in about a half hour — and is looking to add more, particularly heading north toward Kamloops and Prince George. There is also a network of Tesla superchargers. In any case, 80 per cent of charging happens at home, Scott says. ""What a lot of people don't realize is all it requires is actually your standard 120-volt outlet,"" she said. An eight-hour charge is enough to power an electric vehicle for a range of about 40 kilometres. ""That might not sound like a lot, but 94 per cent of all car trips across the province are actually less than 30 kilometres,"" Scott said. The prevalence of overnight charging helps take some of the pressure off the network in terms of power demand, she explained, because it happens at a time when most other electrical appliances are turned off. Increasingly, charging stations are being introduced at workplace parking lots and new condo buildings. However, for those relying on free street parking or who live under strict strata rules, charging can be a bit more of a hassle — like for one Vancouver couple who found they had to park and charge their electric car a 10-minute walk from their home. The infrastructure may still be patchy, but Scott says the potential savings of driving electric remain tempting. ""The prime motivation for buying an electric vehicle would be to save money on gas and maintenance and, obviously with the rising gas prices, that makes a lot of sense,"" she said.",gas prices soaring pushing cars province ready go electric,british columbians may considering buying electric vehicle last week gas prices soaring new laws introduced requiring cars trucks sold province zero emission consideration comes questions future electric vehicles province infrastructure support includes everything charging options whether bc hydro handle demand extra electricity bring hydro predicts least fully electric cars roads something planning terms load forecast said mora scott spokesperson bc hydro continuing expand system enough power battery range charging questions concerns around range electric vehicles charging already boasts thousand public charging stations tofino alberta border scott told early edition bc hydro also systems across province charge car battery per cent capacity half hour looking add particularly heading north toward kamloops prince george also network tesla superchargers case per cent charging happens home scott says lot people realize requires actually standard outlet said charge enough power electric vehicle range kilometres might sound like lot per cent car trips across province actually less kilometres scott said prevalence overnight charging helps take pressure network terms power demand explained happens time electrical appliances turned increasingly charging stations introduced workplace parking lots new condo buildings however relying free street parking live strict strata rules charging bit hassle like one vancouver couple found park charge electric car walk home infrastructure may still patchy scott says potential savings driving electric remain tempting prime motivation buying electric vehicle would save money gas maintenance obviously rising gas prices makes lot sense said

The increase comes on the heels of Tesla making Autopilot standard and won't exactly thrill buyers who can't buy before May. However, there is a reason for the move: Tesla is showing off its next-gen driverless technology, which comes in tandem with a new computer, at an investor meeting on April 22nd. The company appears to have a better sense of the price of autonomy now that it's closer to becoming a practical reality, and it's passing that cost along to newer customers.

In a message to employees last week, Ma said that many workers lack the opportunity to put in extra hours at work, so those with the option should take full advantage of it. ""I personally think that being able to work 996 is a huge blessing,"" Ma said Thursday in remarks posted on Alibaba's WeChat account. The so-called ""996"" schedule refers to working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. The e-commerce entrepreneur was weighing in on a growing debate around work-life balance that has emerged among Chinese tech employees in recent weeks. Last month, activists on Microsoft's code-sharing site GitHub set up a discussion group called ""996.ICU,"" suggesting that employees who work those hours could experience burnout and end up in an intensive care unit. ""Many companies and many people don't have the opportunity to work 996,"" Ma continued, referring to under-performing firms. ""If you don't work 996 when you are young, when can you ever work 996?"" The 54-year-old former teacher, who is today one of China's richest people, noted that he and his fellow co-founders all put in long hours in Alibaba's early days. He said that dedication was vital to the company's success. ""Let me ask everyone, if you don't put out more time and energy than others, how can you achieve the success you want?"" Ma wrote. ""Compared to them, up to this day, I still feel lucky, I don't regret (working 12 hour days), I would never change this part of me."" Perhaps unsurprisingly, Ma's comments were met with a backlash online, where many commentators argued that overtime hours are a huge blessing for employers only. ""Well, for him it is a blessing. Just not for his employees,"" one contributor wrote on Reddit. Ma is not alone in his advocacy for overtime. In November, fellow billionaire entrepreneur and Tesla founder Elon Musk, a fervent advocate of long working hours, tweeted that ""nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week."" However, the Alibaba chairman tempered his comments on Sunday, saying that the decision to work overtime should be taken by employees, rather than enforced by employers. Companies that try to force such practices are ""foolish"" and doomed to fail, he said. ""No one likes working at a company that forces you to do '996'. Not only is it inhumane, it's unhealthy and even more unsustainable for long periods – plus workers, relatives and the law do not approve of it,"" he wrote in a post on Chinese micro-blogging site Weibo. ""If you find a job you like, the 996 problem does not exist; if you're not passionate about it, every minute of going to work is a torment,"" he added. Ma's comments come after an opinion piece in Chinese state newspaper the People's Daily on Thursday argued on that 996 violate's the country's labor law.

Think again. Days after the company's announcement of Model 3 lineup and price changes, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter that the ""price of the Tesla Full Self-Driving option will increase substantially over time."" In a subsequent tweet, Musk said these changes will start on May 1. And answering a comment which asked whether the price increase will be to the tune of ""a few thousand dollars"" or ""something like +$3,000,"" Musk said it would be ""something like that."" For those unfamiliar with Tesla's nomenclature, the Full Self-Driving (FSD) package is an upgrade to the Autopilot set of features, and enables more advanced features such as automated driving on the highway, automated parking, and Summon, which has the car come to you all by itself, for example on a parking lot. Additionally, Tesla says the feature will also include recognition and responding to traffic lights and stop signs, as well as automatic driving on city streets (as opposed to highways only), in the future. The price for FSD is $5,000 if you order it while ordering the car, and $7,000 if you upgrade to it after delivery. Musk claims that with all this tech constantly being added to the car — the plan is that the car is eventually so autonomous that you can have it taxi other people and earn you money — Tesla cars become ""appreciating assets."" Tesla is also upgrading the FSD computer in all of its cars soon, and will even retrofit cars that have FSD with the new computer should the owner requests it. Electrek notes, however, that it's unclear if all cars are getting the new computer or not. Tesla plans to demonstrate what the new FSD computer can do at an investor meeting on April 22. Tesla recently started bundling Autopilot on all its vehicles (it was previously available as an option), increasing the starting prices by $2,000. And the FSD price hike will likely be quite big — and that's on top of the existing FSD price, which isn't exactly insignificant either. But the good news for potential Tesla owners is that they still have a few weeks to buy a Tesla with FSD onboard at the old price, and have the new hardware installed when it becomes available.",tesla option get expensive,think tesla done messing car prices think days company announcement model lineup price changes tesla ceo elon musk said twitter price tesla full option increase substantially time subsequent tweet musk said changes start may answering comment asked whether price increase tune thousand dollars something like musk said would something like unfamiliar tesla nomenclature full fsd package upgrade autopilot set features enables advanced features automated driving highway automated parking summon car come example parking lot additionally tesla says feature also include recognition responding traffic lights stop signs well automatic driving city streets opposed highways future price fsd order ordering car upgrade delivery musk claims tech constantly added car plan car eventually autonomous taxi people earn money tesla cars become appreciating assets tesla also upgrading fsd computer cars soon even retrofit cars fsd new computer owner requests electrek notes however unclear cars getting new computer tesla plans demonstrate new fsd computer investor meeting april tesla recently started bundling autopilot vehicles previously available option increasing starting prices fsd price hike likely quite big top existing fsd price exactly insignificant either good news potential tesla owners still weeks buy tesla fsd onboard old price new hardware installed becomes available

This is a business that was brought to its knees last year by an IT meltdown. It compounded the problem by the dismal way it communicated with customers during the active phase. The bank also recently unveiled a sharp cut to the fancy interest rates available to savers. Former boss Paul Pester, who departed in the wake of the IT snafu, once said 5 per cent was forever. Apparently forever now means 14 months after which it becomes 3 per cent. As you might imagine, this is a business in serious need of some good PR. But regardless of its motivations for making it, the fraud pledge matters. Fraudsters are sophisticated and clever, and the banking system has some notable gaps within it that they are able to exploit with relative ease. If your details are stolen and you have money taken from your account, they will compensate you. But if you’re tricked into giving your details to a scam artist, or if you are conned into sending a payment to the wrong account, an all too common event, you may not get anything back. Falling victim to this sort of thing can be devastating. Worse still is that fact that if you get hit once the chances are that you’ll get hit again. Criminals share people’s details in the same way that corporations do. The elderly and vulnerable are particularly prone to being targetted. A code of practice is due to come into force next year offering more protection, but it isn’t all encompassing. The phrase “gross negligence” is in there, which you can bet some banks will interpret as applying to anyone unfortunate enough to get tricked. So the TSB pledge matters.

You can understand the trade body’s desire to send out an upbeat message given the unrelenting gloom that has surrounded the sector over the last few years. A 1.4 per cent increase in shopper footfall in March after had fallen in all but two of the previous 22 months would suggest that it had good grounds for doing so. Trouble is, context is everything when it comes to data like this. Add some into the mix and a rather less rosy picture emerges. The comparable figures in 2018 were terrible. Shoppers stayed home rather than braving the “Beast from the East” cold snap, and who could blame them? The chill cooled the high street with a 6 per cent decline in footfall reported during March 2018. The weather was considerably better this time around but the high street didn't come close to recovering what it lost. The rebound was muted indeed. That fact was underlined by the longer term data that the BRC released. On a three month basis, footfall declined by 0.3 per cent. The six and 12 month averages were both at negative 1.4 per cent. Helen Dickinson, the trade body’s chief executive, also made an important point in her comments. The shoppers who were out and about in March were doing more looking than shopping. The higher footfall, she said, did not translate into higher spending. This led Diane Wehrle, springboard marketing and insights director, to talk about the emergence of a “no splurge culture”. Prudence has become the watchword. That’s very understandable at a time when Britain’s dismal government still refuses to formally rule out a no deal crash out of the EU, notwithstanding the clear message from Parliament that such an outcome would be unacceptable and the efforts MPs have made to prevent one. In many ways the cautious stance shoppers have taken is very welcome. The average British consumer has been borrowing with wild abandon in recent years. The stock of unsecured debt they have built up is something that ought to worry policymakers.",retailers report increase high street footfall march shoppers spending,better weather puts spring high street footfall declared british retail consortium brc morning understand trade body desire send upbeat message given unrelenting gloom surrounded sector last years per cent increase shopper footfall march fallen two previous months would suggest good grounds trouble context everything comes data like add mix rather less rosy picture emerges comparable figures terrible shoppers stayed home rather braving beast east cold snap could blame chill cooled high street per cent decline footfall reported march weather considerably better time around high street come close recovering lost rebound muted indeed fact underlined longer term data brc released three month basis footfall declined per cent six month averages negative per cent helen dickinson trade body chief executive also made important point comments shoppers march looking shopping higher footfall said translate higher spending led diane wehrle springboard marketing insights director talk emergence splurge culture prudence become watchword understandable time britain dismal government still refuses formally rule deal crash eu notwithstanding clear message parliament outcome would unacceptable efforts mps made prevent one many ways cautious stance shoppers taken welcome average british consumer borrowing wild abandon recent years stock unsecured debt built something ought worry policymakers

That surely isn't helping mall owners. Foot traffic at some of the best shopping centers across the country peaked around August 2018 and has since started to fall, after rebounding for much of last year, according to a new report from data analytics firm Thasos, which uses more than 100 million mobile phones to track when consumers enter and leave certain trade areas. The good news for a lot of malls was that many retailers made a ""comeback"" and were able to draw in more shoppers by using promotions in 2018, John Collins, Thasos co-founder and chief product officer, said. ""But if you're selling merchandise at a loss, you can only do that for so long."" As retailers are now starting to talk about pulling back on discounting, this could be one reason why traffic is dropping at malls, he said, in addition to the fact that some purchases are moving online. Another issue is landlords have been hoping that offering shoppers new experiences would make it more exciting to go to the mall, but the early evidence isn't showing a boost in activity. Thasos: Traffic has peaked at enclosed malls anchored by department stores  U.S. retailers so far have announced they will shut 5,994 stores, while opening 2,641, according to real estate tracking done by Coresight Research. That's more locations slated to go dark than during last year. In 2018, there were 5,864 closures announced and 3,239 openings, Coresight said. The planned closures include more than 2,000 from Payless ShoeSource, which filed for bankruptcy, hundreds from clothing retailers like Gymboree, Charlotte Russe, Victoria's Secret and Gap, and discount chain Fred's. Meantime, chains like Aldi, Dollar Tree, Ollie's Bargain Outlet, Five Below and Levi's are planning to open more stores. On the closures front, however, the outlook doesn't appear to be getting any better, Coresight predicts. That's after 2017 was a record year for closures announced by U.S. retailers amounting to more than 8,000. ""I expect store closures to accelerate in 2019, hitting some 12,000 by year end,"" Deborah Weinswig, founder and CEO of Coresight, said. ""The slowdown we saw in 2018 seems to have been a brief respite in what's a steady, long-term trend."" Mall and shopping center owners, looking for ways to fill empty space, have in turn been forced to negotiate on lease terms with tenants and settle on cheaper rents. ""It's funny because none of the retailers [closing stores] are surprising,"" DJ Busch, analyst at commercial real estate services firm Green Street Advisors, said. ""But when it happens in a wave, it disrupts negotiating power. It creates a soft point."" Then, landlords are turning to up-and-coming digitally native brands like shirt company Untuckit, glasses maker Warby Parker and mattress retailer Casper, which are opening hundreds of stores as a group across the country after finding success on the internet, to move into their properties. They're hoping adding tenants that provide unique experiences, like Legoland, Crayola Experience and Dave & Busters, will lure shoppers from their homes and out to the mall. But Thasos' Collins said that might not be going as planned. His firm found malls with so-called experiential tenants that aren't just focused on selling products, like Apple, Italian food hall Eataly and Tesla, haven't been drawing in extra traffic. Up until the final three months of 2018, indoor shopping malls with ""experiential"" tenants didn't benefit from greater shopper traffic on a year-over-year basis when compared with indoor malls without any of those unique, nonapparel tenants, Thasos said. Thasos: Experiential tenants not yet offering 'meaningful edge' to traffic like landlords thought  ""This suggests [real estate investment trusts] are overpaying to bring in Tesla and Apple, and others, in order to drive foot traffic to the property,"" Collins said. With more store closures likely on the horizon, consumers can expect to start seeing hotels, gyms, apartment complexes, more food halls and grocery stores at traditional malls, turning them into more like city centers. The new Hudson Yards mall, which opened in New York last month, is the perfect example of this mixed-use model. Mall owners are also experimenting with spaces that let young brands rotate in and out frequently, where they sign short-term leases and gain access to data on foot traffic and shopping patterns. Macerich, the third-largest mall owner in the nation, has a business called BrandBox that it's rolling out at its centers across the U.S. ""I think this is a multiyear transition,"" Busch said. ""Cleanse out some of these retailers that lasted longer than they should have. ... It's going to be tough. Anyone who thinks otherwise is too optimistic. But it doesn't mean this is a dead business. ... It can continue to be a good business as underproductive [retailers] go away, and the strong landlords invest."" Mall owners including Simon, Brookfield, Taubman, Macerich, PREIT, CBL and Washington Prime are expected to report quarterly earnings in the coming weeks and will offer a glimpse at the current leasing environment and how they're dealing with the latest wave of store closures.",offering shoppers new experiences helping malls hit store closure tsunami falling traffic,april already year store closures nearly announced surely helping mall owners foot traffic best shopping centers across country peaked around august since started fall rebounding much last year according new report data analytics firm thasos uses million mobile phones track consumers enter leave certain trade areas good news lot malls many retailers made comeback able draw shoppers using promotions john collins thasos chief product officer said selling merchandise loss long retailers starting talk pulling back discounting could one reason traffic dropping malls said addition fact purchases moving online another issue landlords hoping offering shoppers new experiences would make exciting go mall early evidence showing boost activity thasos traffic peaked enclosed malls anchored department stores retailers far announced shut stores opening according real estate tracking done coresight research locations slated go dark last year closures announced openings coresight said planned closures include payless shoesource filed bankruptcy hundreds clothing retailers like gymboree charlotte russe victoria secret gap discount chain fred meantime chains like aldi dollar tree ollie bargain outlet five levi planning open stores closures front however outlook appear getting better coresight predicts record year closures announced retailers amounting expect store closures accelerate hitting year end deborah weinswig founder ceo coresight said slowdown saw seems brief respite steady trend mall shopping center owners looking ways fill empty space turn forced negotiate lease terms tenants settle cheaper rents funny none retailers closing stores surprising dj busch analyst commercial real estate services firm green street advisors said happens wave disrupts negotiating power creates soft point landlords turning digitally native brands like shirt company untuckit glasses maker warby parker mattress retailer casper opening hundreds stores group across country finding success internet move properties hoping adding tenants provide unique experiences like legoland crayola experience dave busters lure shoppers homes mall thasos collins said might going planned firm found malls experiential tenants focused selling products like apple italian food hall eataly tesla drawing extra traffic final three months indoor shopping malls experiential tenants benefit greater shopper traffic basis compared indoor malls without unique nonapparel tenants thasos said thasos experiential tenants yet offering edge traffic like landlords thought suggests real estate investment trusts overpaying bring tesla apple others order drive foot traffic property collins said store closures likely horizon consumers expect start seeing hotels gyms apartment complexes food halls grocery stores traditional malls turning like city centers new hudson yards mall opened new york last month perfect example model mall owners also experimenting spaces let young brands rotate frequently sign leases gain access data foot traffic shopping patterns macerich mall owner nation business called brandbox rolling centers across think multiyear transition busch said cleanse retailers lasted longer going tough anyone thinks otherwise optimistic mean dead business continue good business underproductive retailers go away strong landlords invest mall owners including simon brookfield taubman macerich preit cbl washington prime expected report quarterly earnings coming weeks offer glimpse current leasing environment dealing latest wave store closures

Business Insider Intelligence At the same time, fossil fuel-powered car sales in the country shrank by almost 15% YoY: Automakers sold over 5.5 million fossil fuel-powered cars in China in Q4 2017, but sold only 4.8 million in the final quarter of last year. Here's what it means: The spike in EV sales in Q1 is likely a function of the Chinese government's bolstering of growth in the country's electric car market. The Chinese government is gradually rolling out initiatives to help wean the country off of fossil fuel-powered cars.The government announced an initiative that calls for carmakers that produce more than 30,000 cars annually to make or import at least 10% electric cars by this year. At the same time, last year China's National Development and Reform Commission announced a $47 billion fund last year that's designed to support EV technologies such as batteries and drivetrains. As the government encourages the production of EVs, it will continue to drive adoption higher: Annual EV sales in China are poised to expand to reach nearly 5.5 million units in 2025, according to IHS Markit estimates cited by The Wall Street Journal. The bigger picture: The EV sales spike and highly promising longer-term market should prompt foreign automakers to accelerate their investment in EV production and assembly in China. Consulting firm Alix Partners projects that global automakers will spend $255 billion on EV research and development through 2023, massive costs they'll want to recoup in the form of profits sooner rather than later. China will need to be a part of that strategy, especially for US automakers: While 254,000 EVs were sold in China last quarter, less than 50,000 were sold in the US over the same period. A handful of foreign automakers are already dumping money into the country, both on their own and through partnerships with local players. Tesla is in the midst of building a factory in Shanghai that will reportedly be ready to turn out cars by 2023. Volkswagen, meanwhile, is reportedly in talks with SK Innovation, a local tech company, to co-develop EV batteries in the country. Automakers should consider their approach to bringing EVs to the Chinese market now in order to take advantage of the significant opportunity that's starting to take shape.

And he said Tesla was far ahead of other companies working on self-driving technology. ""To me right now, this seems 'game, set, and match,'"" Musk said. ""I could be wrong, but it appears to be the case that Tesla is vastly ahead of everyone."" Musk told Fridman that Tesla customers would need to keep their hands on the wheel ""for at least six months or something like that."" But he predicted that soon—""maybe even toward the end of this year, I'd be shocked if it's not next year at the latest""—Tesla's self-driving technology will become so good that ""having a human intervene will decrease safety."" Musk has maintained an optimistic mood about Tesla's self-driving progress at the same time that other industry CEOs have been tamping down expectations. (Musk is congenitally optimistic on this topic—in 2015, he predicted that fully self-driving cars would be ready within two years, declaring it a ""much easier problem than people think it is."") ""We overestimated the arrival of autonomous vehicles,"" Ford CEO Jim Hackett said on Tuesday. Ford is aiming to introduce fully self-driving vehicles in 2021, but Hackett cautioned ""its applications will be narrow, what we call geo-fenced, because the problem is so complex."" “Not even close” Does Tesla really have a large lead over its rivals? At least one expert is skeptical. ""Tesla Autopilot is not yet even close to where Waymo was 6 years ago,"" wrote Brad Templeton, a longtime self-driving car evangelist who advised Google during the early years of its self-driving car program. By 2012, Google had developed highway driver assistance software that had capabilities similar to recent versions of Autopilot. Google considered selling this technology as a standalone product but decided there was too much danger of drivers becoming overly reliant on the technology—and failing to properly monitor it.

By 2015, Waymo was confident enough in its technology to allow a blind man to ride through residential streets in Austin, Texas. But more than three years later, Google's project—now rechristened Waymo—still hasn't launched a fully driverless taxi service. For its part, Tesla is aiming to add capabilities to handle stoplights and complex intersections later this year, making Tesla's self-driving technology ""feature complete,"" in Musk's terminology. But at that point, customers will still be required to keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road. Further Reading

The question then is how long it will take for the technology to become reliable enough that customer monitoring is no longer required. Musk apparently believes Tesla can reach this point by the end of 2020.

Zoox is developing an autonomous ride-hailing service that it plans to launch in 2020, but unlike nearly all of its most prominent competitors, the company wants to both assemble the electric vehicles it will use for the service and create the software that will allow the cars to drive themselves. Each of those tasks is daunting — ask the Google spin-off Waymo, which took nearly a decade to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service that operates on a limited basis in parts of Arizona, or Tesla, which has been the only electric vehicle startup to find long-term success, but has struggled mightily with production — doing both at the same time only increases the level of difficulty, particularly for a startup that was founded just five years ago. ""They're worthy and interesting challenges. I wake up every morning, and I'm in a hurry to get here,"" Evans said in an interview with Business Insider. Evans joined Zoox in February after serving as the senior vice president and chief strategy officer at Intel. She was happy at Intel, and would only consider leaving for a company that carried the promise of societal impact, featured employees and a founder she could get along with, and wouldn't require her to move her family. ""When you're a young girl from Senegal and you end up sitting in my shoes, impact and meaning is very important,"" she said. In the most basic sense, Zoox's task is to create and combine complex hardware and software. At Intel, Evans gained experience leading projects that involved the integration of hardware and software that had to be able to communicate quickly. Those projects required her to navigate between network operators, equipment manufacturers, customers, and regulators — a skill Evans said she can apply at Zoox. Now, her priorities are preparing Zoox to handle the transition from developing ideas to bringing those ideas to the market, and ensuring the company's autonomous driving technology is safe enough for consumers. ""Safety, in everything we do, is super critical,"" Evans said. Zoox has a few advantages that will make its challenges more manageable, Evans said. First, it has a narrow focus: Its software and vehicles will only be used in a ride-hailing service that operates in a dense environment, rather than for personal ownership or deliveries. Second, the company plans to produce those vehicles at a small scale. ""We're talking thousands here — low thousands. We're not talking hundreds of thousands,"" Evans said. As far as software is concerned, Evans is encouraged by the progress Zoox has made. She cited the 7.5-mile ""challenge route"" the company uses to test its autonomous-driving technology in San Francisco. The route features steep hills, narrow roads, unprotected left-turns, construction zones, and double-parked cars. Evans said the number of disengagements (when a safety driver has to take over for the vehicle) is ""low"" but ""still too high."" ""I don't think people realize how much progress we've made,"" Evans said, before acknowledging that is due in part to the fact that Zoox has yet to reveal the vehicles it plans to use, ""but this is not some hypothesis on some PowerPoint slide, I see [Zoox's vehicles] every day.""",zoox ceo aicha evans reveals set company electric cars apart rest,zoox ceo aicha evans big challenge ahead turning ambitious idea business zoox developing autonomous service plans launch unlike nearly prominent competitors company wants assemble electric vehicles use service create software allow cars drive tasks daunting ask google waymo took nearly decade launch autonomous service operates limited basis parts arizona tesla electric vehicle startup find success struggled mightily production time increases level difficulty particularly startup founded five years ago worthy interesting challenges wake every morning hurry get evans said interview business insider evans joined zoox february serving senior vice president chief strategy officer intel happy intel would consider leaving company carried promise societal impact featured employees founder could get along would require move family young girl senegal end sitting shoes impact meaning important said basic sense zoox task create combine complex hardware software intel evans gained experience leading projects involved integration hardware software able communicate quickly projects required navigate network operators equipment manufacturers customers regulators skill evans said apply zoox priorities preparing zoox handle transition developing ideas bringing ideas market ensuring company autonomous driving technology safe enough consumers safety everything super critical evans said zoox advantages make challenges manageable evans said first narrow focus software vehicles used service operates dense environment rather personal ownership deliveries second company plans produce vehicles small scale talking thousands low thousands talking hundreds thousands evans said far software concerned evans encouraged progress zoox made cited challenge route company uses test technology san francisco route features steep hills narrow roads unprotected construction zones cars evans said number disengagements safety driver take vehicle low still high think people realize much progress made evans said acknowledging due part fact zoox yet reveal vehicles plans use hypothesis powerpoint slide see zoox vehicles every day

Scott Fitzgerald famously wrote there were ""no second acts in American lives."" Though it's possible the writer was taken out of context, Keith Block says that Salesforce.com, the $124 billion cloud software company he leads as co-CEO with Marc Benioff, has been lucky in that regard. In Block's view, the company has reinvented itself several times over the 20 years since it first came into existence, each time establishing itself as a major player in a new market. ""I think most companies have one act,"" Block told Business Insider. ""Salesforce has had a second act, third act, fourth."" The first act was the customer-relationship-management cloud software, now known as Sales Cloud, that launched the company in 1999. Act two was Service Cloud, its product for customer-support agents, which he says is poised to overtake Sales Cloud and become Salesforce's biggest business this year. The third, he says, was its Marketing Cloud. Now, Block is trying to guide Salesforce through what he sees as Salesforce's fourth act: applying artificial intelligence to the vast amounts of data that its customers are increasingly generating to come up with fresh insight into better ways to do business. To that end, Salesforce recently paid $6.5 billion for its largest acquisition ever: MuleSoft, a company that helps gather and sift data from even the oldest business software.

Founded in 2016, Simi's JetBlue team is an unlikely presence in Silicon Valley's start-up scene. Airlines usually don't spend much time investing in early-stage tech start-ups. And, yet, here they are. In many ways, it's only fitting that the leader of this unorthodox firm is someone who took such an unorthodox route to get here. The Mt. Baldy, California native told Business Insider there was one point in her youth that helped her determine what she wanted to achieve. During a high school assembly, the motivational speaker John Goddard challenged the students to make a list of 100 things they wanted to accomplish in life. ""I thought to myself, I can't think of 100 things to do, but I can think of five,"" she said. A JetBlue Embraer E190 airliner.

It's common for people to come up with to-do lists. It happens every day. But Simi's list is special. If not only for its varied interests and sheer ambition but also for the verve with which she tackled each entry — to go to a good college, to work in television, to become a pilot, to compete in the Olympics, and to build a log cabin. After high school, Simi, then known as Bonny Warner, ticked off the first entry on the list. She attended Stanford University on a field hockey scholarship. Simi noted that the financial challenges faced by her family meant a scholarship was really the key to her being able to attend college. ""We didn't have a lot of money,"" Simi said. ""My mom was a single mom with two kids and was a disabled school teacher."" Simi thrived at Stanford where she was the goalie of the field hockey team. However, it was her victory in an essay writing contest that propelled her into the next chapter of her life. Read more: JetBlue is going to London in 2021. The contest was to serve as a torch bearer for the 1980 Winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid, New York. It was during this experience when Simi was first told that women were not allowed to participate in the bobsled competition. ""You can't tell me I can't do something,"" she said of her reaction.""So I said 'I want to bobsled!'"" Since the women's bobsled event was not added to the Olympics until the 2002 Salt Lake City games, a change for which Simi helped lobby, she chose the next best thing by becoming a luger.

So she took time off Stanford and entered a training program to become an Olympic luger all the while cleaning hotel rooms to pay the bills. By 1984, Simi was considered America's best female luger and went on to compete in the 1984, the 1988, and the 1992 Winter Olympic games. In between her Olympic appearances, Simi graduated from college and went to work as a sportscaster with ABC in the San Francisco Bay area 1988. She also earned her pilot's license. Even though Simi would continue to work as a television commentator during the Olympics until 2002, she would leave her full-time TV career behind in 1990 to join United Airlines as a pilot. ""I was so excited to become an airline pilot. To me, it was equal or even potentially greater than becoming an Olympian,"" Simi said. She spent 13 years at United Airlines where she flew a range of aircraft including the Boeing 727, 737, and 777. Eventually, she was promoted to Captain on United's 727 and 737 fleets.

""I decided I wanted to work for a startup, I loved flying and I didn't want to leave aviation,"" Simi said of her decision to join JetBlue. ""I wanted to work for an entrepreneur, I wanted to work for a company that had a caring culture, and a great brand."" ""People thought I was crazy, I left United as a very senior captain to go to JetBlue to be junior first officer,"" she added. ""It was a huge pay cut. It was a sort of leap of faith."" Simi compared her departure from United to entrepreneurs who quit their jobs to pursue their endeavors because they have the feeling there's more out there to accomplish. Her gamble paid off. Simi quickly moved into managerial positions within the airline — eventually becoming its head of human resources. Which brings us back to JetBlue Technology Ventures. The idea for the VC firm came from JetBlue's board of directors as a way to keep the company at the forefront of innovation in the airline industry. ""Innovation is only innovative for that snapshot in time, if you don't continue to work on it and continue to find new ideas, you're not innovative anymore,"" Simi said. According to Simi, JetBlue's goal is to be become ""ambidextrous"" in that it wants to not only achieve everyday operational excellence but also remain an innovator. Zunum Aero.
Zunum
Two of Simi's most high-profile investments offer a glimpse into the firm's ambitions. First, there's Zunum Aero. It's a Kirkland, Washington start-up that is working on a new electric-powered regional airliner. According to Zunum, it's small regional aircraft could help bring affordable and environmental air travel to the masses while cutting travel time for many American's by utilizing smaller airports. And then there's Gladly. It's an integrated customer service software system that allows customer service agents to have a holistic view of customers' communication with the airline. That way, an airline's social media team knows what a customer has communicated by telephone while its phone operators now know what the passenger has included in emails. This cuts down on the likelihood of miscommunications and reduces the level of frustration for everyone involved. Gladly software is already in use at JetBlue. While decidedly less ambitious than electric airliners, Gladly's technology could still greatly change the way airlines and its customers communicate. If you've been following along, you probably noticed there's one item on Simi's list that hasn't been able to tackle — that is to build a log cabin.

In an interview with MIT researcher, Lex Fridman, Musk claims that the company should achieve its quest for fully autonomous vehicles in as little as six months, and at the most, in one year. As reported by Ars Technica, Musk said that the vehicles could come to fruition 'maybe even toward the end of this year,' adding, 'I'd be shocked if it's not next year at the latest.' Tesla CEO Elon Musk says fully autonomous vehicles are around the corner, but agggresive estimates have drawn criticism from industry experts. While Musk's claims that Tesla will be delivering the world's first fully autonomous vehicles on an expedited timeline, the forecast has raised the eyebrows of industry skeptics who say the company's overblown projections constitute false advertising at best. In a report last month, one autonomous expert called Musk's prognostications 'unconscionable.' 'Claiming its vehicles will soon be ""feature complete"" for full self-driving is one more step in the unconscionable practices that Tesla is already engaged in with Autopilot — overselling its capabilities and reliability when marketing its vehicles and then blaming the driver for not reading the manual and paying constant attention when the technology inevitably fails,' said Dean Pomerleau, of Carnegie Mellon University in a CNN report. This isn't the first time that Musk has handed down aggressive timelines for the company's autonomous vehicles. In 2015, the Tesla executive estimated that the vehicles would be on the road, well, two years ago. 'It's a much easier problem than people think it is,' Musk told Fortune four years ago. 'But it's not like George Hotz, a one-guy-and-three-months problem. You know, it's more like, thousands of people for two years.' To some, Musk's proclamations are nothing more than a marketing gimmick. In 2015 Musk claimed that self-driving vehicles were just two years away. Steady advancements in software and hardware have propelled self-driving cars into unprecedented territory — Tesla's own models are now pioneering one of the first readily available pieces of software that allow semi-automated driving -- but barriers for fully autonomous vehicles still abound. Current systems still require a human operator to be present at the wheel to intervene in the event of an unforeseen safety hazard, like a pothole or in some cases intentionally designed stickers that cause the car to swerve into oncoming traffic. Waymo, the Google-backed competitor to Tesla's race for autonomous cars, has worked aggressively to gain permits for its self-driving vehicles on the road, deploying a fleet of taxis in Arizona this month. Waymo taxis still currently come equipped with a human overseer. No one can say for sure when fully autonomous vehicles will begin to be regularly deployed on roadways, but according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, they will likely come beyond 2025. Self-driving cars often use a combination of normal two-dimensional cameras and depth-sensing 'LiDAR' units to recognise the world around them. However, others make use of visible light cameras that capture imagery of the roads and streets. They are trained with a wealth of information and vast databases of hundreds of thousands of clips which are processed using artificial intelligence to accurately identify people, signs and hazards. In LiDAR (light detection and ranging) scanning - which is used by Waymo - one or more lasers send out short pulses, which bounce back when they hit an obstacle. These sensors constantly scan the surrounding areas looking for information, acting as the 'eyes' of the car. While the units supply depth information, their low resolution makes it hard to detect small, faraway objects without help from a normal camera linked to it in real time. In November last year Apple revealed details of its driverless car system that uses lasers to detect pedestrians and cyclists from a distance. The Apple researchers said they were able to get 'highly encouraging results' in spotting pedestrians and cyclists with just LiDAR data. They also wrote they were able to beat other approaches for detecting three-dimensional objects that use only LiDAR. Other self-driving cars generally rely on a combination of cameras, sensors and lasers. An example is Volvo's self driving cars that rely on around 28 cameras, sensors and lasers. A network of computers process information, which together with GPS, generates a real-time map of moving and stationary objects in the environment. Twelve ultrasonic sensors around the car are used to identify objects close to the vehicle and support autonomous drive at low speeds. A wave radar and camera placed on the windscreen reads traffic signs and the road's curvature and can detect objects on the road such as other road users. Four radars behind the front and rear bumpers also locate objects. Two long-range radars on the bumper are used to detect fast-moving vehicles approaching from far behind, which is useful on motorways. Four cameras - two on the wing mirrors, one on the grille and one on the rear bumper - monitor objects in close proximity to the vehicle and lane markings.",musk says tesla vastly ahead claims cars fully autonomous next year,fully autonomous vehicles may still technically horizon according ceo elon musk tesla dominance market already set match interview mit researcher lex fridman musk claims company achieve quest fully autonomous vehicles little six months one year reported ars technica musk said vehicles could come fruition even toward end year adding shocked next year latest tesla ceo elon musk says fully autonomous vehicles around corner agggresive estimates drawn criticism industry experts musk claims tesla delivering world first fully autonomous vehicles expedited timeline forecast raised eyebrows industry skeptics say company overblown projections constitute false advertising best report last month one autonomous expert called musk prognostications vehicles soon feature complete full one step unconscionable practices tesla already engaged autopilot overselling capabilities reliability marketing vehicles blaming driver reading manual paying constant attention technology inevitably fails said dean pomerleau carnegie mellon university cnn report first time musk handed aggressive timelines company autonomous vehicles tesla executive estimated vehicles would road well two years ago much easier problem people think musk told fortune four years ago like george hotz problem know like thousands people two years musk proclamations nothing marketing gimmick musk claimed vehicles two years away steady advancements software hardware propelled cars unprecedented territory tesla models pioneering one first readily available pieces software allow driving barriers fully autonomous vehicles still abound current systems still require human operator present wheel intervene event unforeseen safety hazard like pothole cases intentionally designed stickers cause car swerve oncoming traffic waymo competitor tesla race autonomous cars worked aggressively gain permits vehicles road deploying fleet taxis arizona month waymo taxis still currently come equipped human overseer one say sure fully autonomous vehicles begin regularly deployed roadways according national highway traffic safety administration likely come beyond cars often use combination normal cameras units recognise world around however others make use visible light cameras capture imagery roads streets trained wealth information vast databases hundreds thousands clips processed using artificial intelligence accurately identify people signs hazards lidar light detection ranging scanning used waymo one lasers send short pulses bounce back hit obstacle sensors constantly scan surrounding areas looking information acting car units supply depth information low resolution makes hard detect small faraway objects without help normal camera linked real time november last year apple revealed details driverless car system uses lasers detect pedestrians cyclists distance apple researchers said able get encouraging results spotting pedestrians cyclists lidar data also wrote able beat approaches detecting objects use lidar cars generally rely combination cameras sensors lasers example volvo self driving cars rely around cameras sensors lasers network computers process information together gps generates map moving stationary objects environment twelve ultrasonic sensors around car used identify objects close vehicle support autonomous drive low speeds wave radar camera placed windscreen reads traffic signs road curvature detect objects road road users four radars behind front rear bumpers also locate objects two radars bumper used detect vehicles approaching far behind useful motorways four cameras two wing mirrors one grille one rear bumper monitor objects close proximity vehicle lane markings

But myths about how much sleep we need are rising to the level of a 'public health threat,' according to a new New York University study. The most damaging is the idea you can get by on five or fewer hours of shut-eye a night, as Trump insists he does. Americans also believe that snoring is harmless and that a 'night cap' will send you into a more peaceful slumber - but these are all false and harmful to our health, the study authors warn. President Donald Trump has boasted that he needs less than five hours of sleep a night - but a new study warns that this is unhealthy - and that such myths pose a 'public health danger' (file) Britain and the US are among the most sleep deprived countries in the world. Not getting enough has been linked with a host of diseases from dementia to heart disease and cancer. Study leader Dr Rebecca Robbins, an epidemiologist at New York University's School of Medicine, said: 'Sleep is a vital part of life that affects our productivity, mood and general health and well-being. 'Dispelling myths about sleep promotes healthier sleep habits which, in turn, promote overall better health.' In the first investigation of its kind, her team reviewed over 8,000 websites to identify the 20 most common assumptions. Sleep medicine experts ranked each based on if they could be dispelled as fiction or supported by scientific evidence - and on the harm it could cause. The claim by some that they can survive on only five hours a night was among the top myths they were able to refute. It also poses the most serious risk to health from long-term sleep deficits, said the researchers. They suggest creating a consistent sleep schedule and spending more time asleep - at least seven hours, as recommended by the World Health Organization, American Heart Association and various sleep and public health experts the world over. DONALD TRUMP President Donald Trump says he sleeps four to five hours. He claims that this is a key to his business success. Trump once asked 'How does somebody that’s sleeping 12 and 14 hours a day compete with someone that’s sleeping three or four?' Some have suggests he shares a genetic trait with Margaret Thatcher that make them part of the 'sleepless elite' who need less shut-eye than most. JACK DORSEY The Twitter CEO claims to stick to an eccentric 'health' regimen. He has said he sleeps between 11:00 pm and 5:00 am. In his waking hours, Dorsey claims to  eat only dinner, nothing at all on Saturdays, meditate for 30 hours and work out three times for seven minutes a time each day. ELON MUSK Musk, who is at the helm of both SpaceX and Tesla claims to function best with minimal sleep. He believes he is not as sharp when he sleeps seven hours. Instead, Musk aims for six to six-and-a-half hours of snooze time a night. He also purports that his tight sleep schedule is a byproduct of his supposed 120-hour work weeks. This would avoid the effects of this falsehood and others identified such as the value of taking naps when you routinely have difficulty sleeping overnight. Many people also believe that snoring is completely harmless, according to the new study. In some cases this is true, but in others, the noisy nighttime habit can signal that someone may have sleep apnea. It causes breathing to stop and start over the course of the night. Sleep apnea has, in turn, been associated with the development of dementia. The researchers said patients should not to dismiss loud snoring but see a doctor since it may lead to heart stoppages or other illnesses. They also found sufficient evidence in published studies that, despite beliefs to the contrary, drinking booze before bed is indeed unhealthy for sleep. According to experts alcohol reduces the body's ability to achieve deep sleep which people need to function properly. Co-author Dr Girardin Jean Louis, a psychiatrist at NYU, said: 'Sleep is important to health and there needs to be greater effort to inform the public regarding this important public health issue. 'For example, by discussing sleep habits with their patients, doctors can help prevent sleep myths from increasing risks for heart disease, obesity, and diabetes.' The researchers, whose findings are published in Sleep Health, say some myths still cause disagreement - even among experts. This is particularly true when it comes to people who can't get optimal sleep any way. For instance, some scientists say that sleeping in on the weekend disrupts the natural circadian rhythm or body clock. But, then again, others say that shift workers who don't generally get healthy sleep are better off 'catching up' on sleep when they can. These discrepancies, they say, suggest further research needs to be done.",take trump sleep advice myths making us sick study warns,people financial success fame like president trump twitter ceo jack dorsey tesla spacex ceo elon musk love brag little sleep need myths much sleep need rising level health threat according new new york university study damaging idea get five fewer hours night trump insists americans also believe snoring harmless cap send peaceful slumber false harmful health study authors warn president donald trump boasted needs less five hours sleep night new study warns unhealthy myths pose health danger file britain us among sleep deprived countries world getting enough linked host diseases dementia heart disease cancer study leader dr rebecca robbins epidemiologist new york university school medicine said vital part life affects productivity mood general health myths sleep promotes healthier sleep habits turn promote overall better health first investigation kind team reviewed websites identify common assumptions sleep medicine experts ranked based could dispelled fiction supported scientific evidence harm could cause claim survive five hours night among top myths able refute also poses serious risk health sleep deficits said researchers suggest creating consistent sleep schedule spending time asleep least seven hours recommended world health organization american heart association various sleep public health experts world donald trump president donald trump says sleeps four five hours claims key business success trump asked somebody sleeping hours day compete someone sleeping three four suggests shares genetic trait margaret thatcher make part elite need less jack dorsey twitter ceo claims stick eccentric regimen said sleeps pm waking hours dorsey claims eat dinner nothing saturdays meditate hours work three times seven minutes time day elon musk musk helm spacex tesla claims function best minimal sleep believes sharp sleeps seven hours instead musk aims six hours snooze time night also purports tight sleep schedule byproduct supposed work weeks would avoid effects falsehood others identified value taking naps routinely difficulty sleeping overnight many people also believe snoring completely harmless according new study cases true others noisy nighttime habit signal someone may sleep apnea causes breathing stop start course night sleep apnea turn associated development dementia researchers said patients dismiss loud snoring see doctor since may lead heart stoppages illnesses also found sufficient evidence published studies despite beliefs contrary drinking booze bed indeed unhealthy sleep according experts alcohol reduces body ability achieve deep sleep people need function properly dr girardin jean louis psychiatrist nyu said important health needs greater effort inform public regarding important public health issue example discussing sleep habits patients doctors help prevent sleep myths increasing risks heart disease obesity diabetes researchers whose findings published sleep health say myths still cause disagreement even among experts particularly true comes people ca get optimal sleep way instance scientists say sleeping weekend disrupts natural circadian rhythm body clock others say shift workers generally get healthy sleep better sleep discrepancies say suggest research needs done

The language it used this morning - redolent of that of the protestors - is unusual for a big City fund manager. They mostly prefer to rely upon bland self serving twaddle, where they will even respond to issues like the one LGIM raises. It is both welcome and justified. It isn’t just the protestors LGIM is lining up alongside (sort of). It is science, which clearly shows the fund manager’s assessment of the problem is an accurate one. Climate change will have a devastating impact on the world’s economies and businesses, and thus upon its own business. But describing the problem is easy. Addressing it requires more than just words. To give it its due, LGIM recognises this. It says it will vote against company chairs across the entirety of its equity holdings where their companies are deemed to have taken “insufficient action on climate risks”. Given that LGIM oversees £1tn of investments, that matters. It has clout. The asset manager will also name and shame those big businesses it finds wanting for the second year in a row this summer, and they will be excluded from its Future World range of funds, launched last year. It is always possible to hold a debate about how one views “sufficient action” and whether the criteria used are sufficiently stringent. However, the fund manager’s Active Ownership report, published this morning, reveals that LGIM voted against 3,864 company directors globally last year, representing a 37 percent increase over 2017. So the direction of travel is clear. On a less positive note, the report also serves to highlight the dismal performance of other fund managers that either don’t vote their holdings, or tamely back boards even where they engage in behaviours that are ultimately damaging to the interests of their investors. LGIM is not alone with its activism but it, and the other groups that take their “stewardship” roles seriously, are still in the minority. That can be seen in the fact that while investor rebellions are more common than they used to be, defeats are still vanishingly rare.",l g takes climate protests boardroom,climate protestors step activity london legal general investment management lgim making noise boardroom aim forcing action freely describes catastrophe language used morning redolent protestors unusual big city fund manager mostly prefer rely upon bland self serving twaddle even respond issues like one lgim raises welcome justified protestors lgim lining alongside sort science clearly shows fund manager assessment problem accurate one climate change devastating impact world economies businesses thus upon business describing problem easy addressing requires words give due lgim recognises says vote company chairs across entirety equity holdings companies deemed taken insufficient action climate risks given lgim oversees investments matters clout asset manager also name shame big businesses finds wanting second year row summer excluded future world range funds launched last year always possible hold debate one views sufficient action whether criteria used sufficiently stringent however fund manager active ownership report published morning reveals lgim voted company directors globally last year representing percent increase direction travel clear less positive note report also serves highlight dismal performance fund managers either vote holdings tamely back boards even engage behaviours ultimately damaging interests investors lgim alone activism groups take stewardship roles seriously still minority seen fact investor rebellions common used defeats still vanishingly rare

The organisation raised questions over their veracity in its latest report. I’m not quite sure what to think of the statement given that my Amazon Music app regularly exhorts me to “rate us five stars”. The temptation to do that just to get rid of the annoying pop up is clear. But were I to do so I’d be submitting a fake review. I don’t believe Amazon Music deserves quite such an exalted rating. It’s a good service, worth a subscription, but it isn’t always as user friendly as I’d hope. At the same time, however, Which? has an interest here too. “Don’t buy based on a lie. Our reviews tell you the truth,” it declares, exhorting people to sign up. I have a membership and while its reviews are admirably comprehensive, and I regularly refer to them, I wouldn’t say I always agree with them. When it comes to reviews, truth is in the eye of the beholder. But Which? is still justified in raising the issue and Amazon should it take seriously. The flaws in user generated content, like the reviews that appear on its site, have recently been made clear by the reaction of right wingers to Captain Marvel. The superhero flick was in receipt of a barrage of negative reviews from trolls before it had even been released in the wake of its star, Brie Larson, voicing concerns about the “overwhelmingly white male” film journalists she was speaking to during a promotional tour. Bad enough that Marvel chose a woman to front a film after only 20 previous outings. But she then went and dared to make a point. Rotten Tomatoes responded to the right wing snowflakes who were triggered by her comments by barring users from commenting on films prior to their release. They failed to stop Captain Marvel from enjoying huge critical and commercial success. The filtering out of fake positive product reviews, if they appear, is arguably a bigger, and more important, issue because shoppers apparently give a lot more credence to rave write ups seen on Amazon than they do to negative trolling on Rotten Tomatoes (which also aggregates professional reviews).",claims flood fake five star reviews amazon,invest significant resources protect integrity reviews store know customers value insights experiences shared fellow said amazon response reporting flood five star reviews relatively unknown brands online giant website organisation raised questions veracity latest report quite sure think statement given amazon music app regularly exhorts rate us five stars temptation get rid annoying pop clear submitting fake review believe amazon music deserves quite exalted rating good service worth subscription always user friendly hope time however interest buy based lie reviews tell truth declares exhorting people sign membership reviews admirably comprehensive regularly refer say always agree comes reviews truth eye beholder still justified raising issue amazon take seriously flaws user generated content like reviews appear site recently made clear reaction right wingers captain marvel superhero flick receipt barrage negative reviews trolls even released wake star brie larson voicing concerns overwhelmingly white male film journalists speaking promotional tour bad enough marvel chose woman front film previous outings went dared make point rotten tomatoes responded right wing snowflakes triggered comments barring users commenting films prior release failed stop captain marvel enjoying huge critical commercial success filtering fake positive product reviews appear arguably bigger important issue shoppers apparently give lot credence rave write ups seen amazon negative trolling rotten tomatoes also aggregates professional reviews

Gucci billionaire François-Henri Pinault , and husband of Hollywood star Salma Hayek, has offered £90 million to help restore its architecture and bring the building back to life. The businessman, who owns brands such as Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, said the funds will go towards helping with the ""complete reconstruction"" of Notre Dame. However, he&aposs since been outbid by Bernard Arnault - the 70-year-old magnate behind iconic fashion label Louis Vuitton who offered €200 million. But as the two tycoons go head-to-head in their efforts to save Notre Dame - we&aposre thinking back at other famous faces that have made amazing - and unusual - donations, from Jeff Bezos to George Michael. In 2010, Bill and Melinda Gates formed The Giving Pledge alongside billionaire friend Warren Buffett. As part of the foundation, they vowed to give most of their wealth to charity over their lifetime and after death - with the money going towards improving healthcare and bringing people out of poverty across the world. Speaking on his ideas behind the scheme, Gates said it is ""about building on a wonderful tradition of philanthropy that will ultimately help the world become a much better place"". By 2018, at least 175 people had committed to donating large amounts of their fortunes to the Giving Pledge, including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. It&aposs estimated it could be worth as much as £350billion by 2022. Speaking on passing his wealth down to his children, Gates once said he was ""not a favour"" of handing down huge sums. ""It distorts anything they might do, creating their own path. ""This money is dedicated to helping the poorest. They know that, they are proud of that, they go on trips with us to see the work that’s being done."" World&aposs richest man Jeff Bezos emerged as a leading supporter of world charities last year. According to the latest Philanthropy 50 list, a ranking of America’s top 50 donors, the Amazon boss made more charitable donations than anyone else in the US in 2018, including philanthropists with comparable fortunes such as former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and Microsoft’s Bill Gates. The Amazon boss donated £1.5billion of his £104billion Amazon empire to good causes in 2018 through his Bezos Day One Fund, a charity founded by his recently ex-wife MacKenzie Bezos. This money goes towards supporting homelessness and poverty, in addition to funding preschool education in low-income communities. NBA superstar Lebron James has spent millions of pounds from his fortune supporting schools in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. The basketball pro, 34, set up the Lebron James Family Foundation in 2004. The charity raises and donates money for several schemes including Boys and Girls Clubs of America, After-School All-Stars, the Children’s Defense Fund, Gabriel’s Angle Foundation and ONEXONE. After-School All-Stars started as a bike-a-thon, “Wheels For Education” to raise money for children in Akron to help with education and a place to go after school. It developed into a program to help ""at risk"" children of Akron in a variety of ways. The program provides mentoring with education as well as extracurricular activities. Former talk show host Oprah Winfrey has funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars into various organisations and charities over the course of her career. Donations include £7 million to Hurricane Katrina relief - she also lobbied for the National Child Protection Act, which established a national database of convicted child abusers and went on to be known as the ""Oprah Bill"" in 1993. Some examples of her projects include The Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa and Mississippi Animal Rescue League. In 2005, Oprah reported live from the Gulf Coast just days after Hurricane Katrina. During the The Oprah Winfrey Show&aposs 20th season premiere, she committed millions of her own money to rebuilding the Gulf Coast, including homes and damaged lives. She also launched the Oprah&aposs Angel Network Katrina Homes Registry so viewers could help fill the homes with furniture, picture frames and other items that were lost in Katrina&aposs wake. Legendary musician George Michael was famed for his generous contributions to causes such as Childline, Los Angeles AIDS and NSPCC - and he continues to donate almost three years after his death. ""Over the years he gave us millions,"" Childline founder Esther Rantzen said, adding that Michael was adamant that nobody know ""how much he gave to the nation&aposs most vulnerable children"". The Wham! singer was also known for secretly donating to strangers in need, including £16,000 to a contestant on ""Deal or No Deal"" who needed money for an IVF treatment. In the year 2000, George Michael bought John Lennon’s piano - the one he composed &aposImagine&apos on - for £1.45million from a private collector. He donated it to the Beatles Story museum in Liverpool so that it could be kept in the UK, and Lennon’s hometown, forever. In 2015, Cristiano Ronaldo was named the world&aposs most generous footballer, having donated millions of pounds of his fortune to worthy causes. The 33-year-old Portuguese star was named by  Dosomething.org  as the most charitable sportsperson, topping the Athletes Gone Good list of 20 stars. ""He raised money for various causes including donating more than $83,000 to a 10-year-old fan in need of brain surgery and giving more than $165,000 to fund a cancer centre in Portugal that treated his mother,"" Dosomething.org said. Other charities he&aposs contributed towards include childhood hunger, obesity and biodiversity. In May 2015, Ronaldo also offered £5 million to help the aid effort in Nepal following an earthquake that devastated many communities and homes. ""My father always taught me that when you help other people, then God will give you double,"" Ronaldo said in 2013. ""And that&aposs what has really happened to me. When I have helped other people who are in need, God has helped me more.” In 2015, he auctioned off his Golden Boot for that year. The £1.25million raised went towards building schools in Gaza. American singer Nicki Minaj famously paid off 37 of her twitter followers&apos student loans in 2017 via her scholarship fund called Student of the Game last year. However, she&aposs long been donating and campaigning for better living conditions in rural India. ""This is the kind of thing that makes me feel the most proud,"" Minaj wrote on her Instagram . Her efforts have helped establish a computer center, a reading program, two water wells, and more infrastructure for different villages in India. Arsenal footballer Hector Bellerin made headlines in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire when he pledged a donation of £50 to the victims of the tragedy for every minute he played for Spain at the Under-21 European Championships in 2017. Spain managed to make it to the final of the tournament held in Poland and Bellerin played 381 minutes along the way, meaning he ended up donating £19,050 to the British Red Cross. Grammy winner John Legend said he was inspired to do more charity work after reading a book called The End of Poverty. Shortly after, he travelled to Ghana to discover about the problems faced by African countries where he said he was inspired to change lives. Legend established the Show Me Campaign to raise the required funds to support those living in underprivileged conditions. The campaign ""seeks to give every child access to a quality education"". It provides mosquito nets to prevent malaria, free meals to children attending school which raises attendance rates and health, safe water points, local clinics and fertilizer to improve crop production and eradicate food shortages. ""Some people will say with some justification that we have a lot of problems here at home that we still need to solve,"" the singer said. ""But I don’t believe you have to choose. I think every life is valuable and poverty anywhere is something we should address."" Aside from his work in Ghana, he also once paid £3,821 in school lunch debts for 99 Seattle schools.",generous celebrity gestures gucci boss pledges rebuild notre dame,two world aposs richest men

2019-04-16 13:30:00+00:00,265.78,268.005,264.82,268.005,52545.2,-2.2250000000000227,cnbc,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/12/can-you-save-money-and-the-planet-by-owning-an-electric-car.html,Can you save money and the planet by owning a Tesla or another electric car?,"You've probably heard of the Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Bolt and Tesla Model 3. And most car companies, if they are not selling an electric vehicle, are working on bringing one to market. But consumers in the market for new cars have a right to ask ""are we there yet?"" when it comes to whether it makes sense to own an electric vehicle — both for financial and environmental reasons. Electric vehicles nearly doubled their market share from 2017 to 2018, according to car research company Edmunds. Still, they represent a small portion of the market. Electric vehicles — including plug-in hybrid cars — accounted for 2% of vehicle sales last year, up from 1.1% in 2017. Much of that jump can be attributed to Tesla's cars, which represented 79% of pure electric vehicle sales in 2018, according to Edmunds. The Model 3 was in the lead, with 59% of electric vehicle sales. While the current market share may seem low, that could be poised to change. Travel organization AAA has found that 20% of individuals indicated this year that they plan to consider an electric vehicle when purchasing their next car. That is up from 15% last year. ""We do believe the future is electric,"" Greg Brannon, director of automotive engineering and industry relations at AAA, said. How quickly that transformation happens will depend on factors including gas prices, which often drive alternative vehicle sales, as well the choices available to consumers, Brannon said. For consumers considering an electric vehicle now, they need to weigh the advantages — and growing pains — that come with acquiring these emerging products. Consumers who buy an electric vehicle are currently eligible for up to $7,500 in tax credits. But those credits have started to phase out for some brands. Once automakers have sold more than 200,000 units, their tax credits are reduced. For Tesla, for example, the tax credit was cut in half on Jan. 1, and is scheduled to be cut in half again on July 1. But a congressional bill proposed last week aims to put a halt to those cuts. The bipartisan legislation — from Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich., and Sens. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., Gary Peters, D-Mich., and Susan Collins, R-Maine — would extend the tax credits to an additional 400,000 electric vehicles per manufacturer.

Investing with equal pay in mind is more difficult than you think Reduced tax credits have been a ""huge deterrent"" for purchasing these vehicles, said Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush. ""If this legislation came through, it would be a huge shot in the arm for Tesla,"" Ives said. The only way to reach widespread adoption — 70% of all automobiles by 2023 or 2024 — is to have these kinds of subsidies in place, Ives said. Prospective electric vehicle owners may assume that once they cut their ties to gasoline, they are free from the costs and guilt associated with it. But that is not entirely the case, according to experts. A big issue with owning an electric vehicle is charging. As models have advanced, the miles of range — or how far you can drive before you recharge it — has extended. Now, consumers can expect new models to last for 200 miles or more, according to Eric Ibara, director of residual values at Kelley Blue Book. But depending on the model you drive, your transportability could be limited. ""A nightmare scenario is you're stuck in traffic on the freeway and your battery dies and you need to call a tow truck,"" Ibara said. Tesla is addressing that issue by putting charging stations across the country. But those stations are only compatible with its cars. Companies such as Electrify America and ChargePoint are also establishing charging stations that work with other car brands. But using these services will cost you, experts warn. ""It's gotten very expensive to publicly charge an electric vehicle,"" said Sam Jaffe, managing director at Cairn ERA. ""Tesla used to give it away for free; they don't with the Model 3. And with other networks, you're paying a lot."" Fully charging your battery — depending on your model — could take anywhere from 40 minutes to eight hours. Meanwhile, many people are turning to electric vehicles as a more environmentally friendly option. But in some respects, electric cars can also be bad for the environment, experts say. ""There's no question that electric vehicles are not environmentally neutral,"" said Jack Gillis, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America and author of ""The Car Book."" While less emissions are produced by the cars themselves while driving on the streets, carbon dioxide is still being emitted by power plants to charge the electric cars, Gillis said. Still, electric vehicles pollute about half as much as traditional cars, including those external power sources, according to Gillis. That makes them ""significantly better"" than gas-powered vehicles for the environment, he said. One catch that comes with buying an electric vehicle is that it can be difficult to sell. That is particularly because the tax credits are only available to the first owners. And because the technology is evolving quickly, electric vehicle owners may be eager to upgrade. A first-generation Nissan Leaf, which was introduced in 2010, had a range of about 85 miles, according to Ron Montoya, senior consumer advice editor at Edmunds, while today's model has about two times as much. Those older models are available on the used car market, he said. ""People always want the most range they can get, so you're going to want to lean towards a newer purchase,"" Montoya said. Another alternative is leasing, which may be attractive to consumers who are not sure if they want to commit to switching the type of car they drive, Ibara said. ""By doing the lease, they may feel, 'Well, in three years, if I don't like it, I'll go back to a gas engine vehicle,'"" Ibara said. ""[It] mentally makes it a little more palatable."" Some consumers, however, are willing to wait. That goes for Brian Wohlgemuth of Indiana, who has test-driven a Tesla and liked it, but found it impractical for his family, which includes nine grandkids. A Model 3 would cost him twice as much as a newer SUV, he said, and a Tesla Model X would cost more than his house payment. And other electric vehicle brands do not compare. ""Tesla's features are a decade ahead of all the other automotive manufacturers,"" Wohlgemuth said.

Tesla announced last week that its semi-autonomous driving feature, Autopilot — which can steer and change lanes on its own — will be a part of all its electric cars ordered online. And now General Motors is adding more self-driving features to its cars with its Super Cruise hands-free system. Super Cruise works a lot like Autopilot, with sensors and cameras and GPS guiding the car, but only on certain highways across the U.S. and Canada, where the computer knows the route. Unlike with Autopilot, drivers don't have to keep their hands on the wheel. A small camera trained on the driver detects when drivers need to snap to attention —and then notifies and alerts drivers to get back into driving mode. Until then, you are literally just sitting behind the wheel, watching the road go by. Self-driving autonomy is based on a scale of 0 to 5, with Level 5 a fully self-driving car. We're not all the way there yet, but Level 2 and 3 autonomy, which offers a mix of human and computer driving, is increasingly widely available, like with Super Cruise and Autopilot. The new Cadillac sedan, the CT5, will include Super Cruise as the start of GM's plan to offer the hands-free driving assistance in all new cars starting in 2020. (The car will first come out this fall without Super Cruise.) Super Cruise was previously only available in the Cadillac CT6 luxury sedan. But now the hands-free driving tool that works on 130,000 miles of mapped-out highways across the country is more widely available. Well, kind of — it's only going to be in two Cadillac models to start and is limited to routes Cadillac has programmed into the system. The car is making its first appearance at the New York Auto Show this week, and although there's no price yet on the new model, predecessors like the Cadillac CTS start around $46,000. Expect this one to be in that ballpark, too. Cadillac is filling the car with a lot of tech beyond Super Cruise. It has a 10-inch screen up front and advanced driver assistance tools like automatic braking, advanced cruise control, parking assistance, and a rear camera mirror, which is much more than a mirror — it actually plays back HD live video of your surroundings.

Now, the construction industry is trying to attract teenagers with realistic computer simulators of those same heavy machines, hoping to build a younger work force. With the retirement of baby boomers in full swing, the construction industry is grappling with its biggest challenge: refilling its pool of employees. But it faces significant resistance among younger workers. Many of them consider the field unstable after six years of double-digit unemployment in the wake of the Great Recession. Or after constantly being told by parents, teachers and politicians that a college education is paramount, they find the work undesirable. “That generation that would bring their kids to work and have them sit on their knee while they are operating a road grader, that generation is gone,” said Ben Eakes, the asset manager for Eutaw Construction Company in Madison, Miss. “We’ve gone through the grandfathers and the fathers,” he added, “and now we are at the generation of the sons, and a lot of the sons aren’t wanting to do this type of work.” And there is a need for fresh blood. Projects are surging, and unemployment in the construction industry was 5.1 percent last year, its lowest rate since at least 2000. Rapidly losing the most experienced workers while demand is high could delay projects and hurt the industry. To attract replacements who grew up playing Call of Duty, some construction companies, unions and schools have turned to simulators that replicate jobs done by heavy equipment, like pushing dirt or lifting steel. Whether it will persuade enough digital natives to embrace hard hats is unclear, but the industry agrees that a revitalization is necessary. More than three-quarters of construction firms in the United States said they were having a hard time filling some or all of their positions, according to a survey by the Associated General Contractors of America that was released in January. Thirty percent said worker shortages were the biggest concern for their firm, by far the most pressing of 16 issues, ranging from growth in federal regulations to rising material costs. Midsize construction companies are most at risk because of the loss of fresh hands in the work force, said Michelle Meisels, who leads the engineering and construction practice at Deloitte Consulting. “If they can’t attract the talent and the boomers are retiring,” she said, “it’s going to be difficult to win work or even deliver work that they have in their backlog.” Eutaw Construction bought its first simulator, an excavator by Caterpillar, late last year and is working to develop its recruiting program by forming partnerships with community colleges and nonprofit organizations. Crane Industry Services, which focuses on training and certification with companies across the United States, wants to teach students who may otherwise be baffled when they drive past a job site populated with machines, said Debbie Dickinson, its chief executive. It recently obtained a portable simulator by CM Labs, a software company in Montreal. “They know they move big things, but how it all works is a mystery,” Ms. Dickinson said. “Until they sit down in the seat of a simulator and the lights start turning on.” Simulators are a popular genre in PC games, with titles like Construction Simulator, Farming Simulator and American Truck Simulator converting the tedium of a job into a form of entertainment. But using a mouse to navigate cannot truly replicate the physical demands of operating heavy machinery. Professional simulators rely on physics and collision engines to create immersion, an experience that intrigued Trey Henry, a 17-year-old senior at the Academy for Career Education trade school in Reno, Nev. He attends a simulator program at the Nevada chapter of Associated General Contractors that serves as training for him and scouting for his instructors, who work for area construction companies. Starting the excavator simulator, a bulky mechanical chair, is more involved than pressing a button to turn on a PlayStation 4. Before the virtual vehicle starts moving, Mr. Henry said, you have to turn a key, increase the throttle speed, engage the hydraulic lock and, yes, buckle your seatbelt. “I was on the excavator and digging a trench, and I got stuck a little bit, and it jerks you like you’re stuck,” Mr. Henry said. “You actually feel the chair moving when you pull the dirt.” The Nevada chapter installed loader and excavator simulators at its headquarters last fall to promote an industry that was hollowed out by the recession, and where regional competition for workers now includes a major Tesla battery plant. Using a simulator means the group does not have to take an actual machine out of service, find a suitable location to operate it or pay for the diesel fuel, said Craig Madole, the chapter’s chief executive. Each simulator cost about $80,000. The excavator, which has three screens, can also be used with an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, which produces a 360-degree outdoor canvas. Two pedals operate the tracks, and joysticks move the boom and open the bucket. Mr. Henry said his experience — he has spent about seven hours on the simulators — had persuaded him to pursue a career working with heavy machinery. That is music to the ears of construction veterans who have been delivering a refrain in unison: A nationwide emphasis on college education has stigmatized the industry, they say, even though its careers offer competitive salaries without the need of an advanced degree. The median salary for construction equipment operators was $46,990 in May 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A shifting economy is another culprit. As family farms have faded in states like Minnesota, so has the familiarity young people once had with machinery, said Jeff Kraemer, the owner of Kraemer Trucking and Excavating in Cold Spring, Minn. It pushed the company to think of alternative ways to introduce students to the trade. This month, in a partnership with Ziegler Cat, it took a trailer of simulators — a bulldozer, a road grader and an excavator — to a local high school. It has held introductory sessions there for several years, and has eventually hired some students who tried the simulators. “What we do is difficult for most people to really understand,” Mr. Kraemer said of construction work. He added that direct exposure to the industry was uncommon. “Anytime you see our type of equipment, the road is closed, it’s blocked up,” he said. The construction industry may be doing a poor job marketing how it integrates technology, such as using drones and artificial intelligence to monitor safety on job sites, said Ms. Meisels, the consultant. Although simulators have been regularly used in aviation and the military, it took time for technological advances to push prices low enough for the average construction company, said Drew Carruthers, the director of training solutions at CM Labs. There has been a general uptick in interest, he said, and the company has emphasized how simulators can provide a return on investment. Operating heavy machinery can be intimidating, and simulators remove the possibility of damaging property or injuring people. Construction companies need the confidence that new operators are not going to destroy their equipment, Mr. Carruthers said. “So what you want in a simulator is a safe environment that puts fear in you that there are consequences for your actions.” Simulators work to engage multiple senses: Most have real controls in the proper locations to help users develop muscle memory. Even the sounds are reproduced accurately. CM Labs records real-life equipment because each squeaky part and every straining engine can indicate optimal performance or incoming disaster. Several students at the Fulton Schools College and Career Academy outside Atlanta said they had determined that the construction industry was not for them after challenging experiences on a crane simulator. It required depth perception and hand-eye coordination to latch the crane’s hook before weaving objects between buildings, cars and streetlamps. “You had to understand people’s lives were in danger,” Christopher Sparks, 17, said. “I felt like every time you hit something, it would move in a certain way so you would have to restart every time. It was like a video game on hard.”",square feet new recruitment tool construction joystick,plastic excavators bulldozers cranes fueled imagination long captivated toddlers construction industry trying

If there was any doubt about how important the Chinese market is to the world's car makers, this year's show should put it to rest, with forward-looking vehicles on show from established OEMs and startups. Some, like the Audi AI:ME point the way to a possible future of autonomous transport. The AI:ME is a followup to 2017's AIcon, this time showing us the company's idea of a much more compact self-driving vehicle. Further Reading
Volkswagen bets big on electric with $25 billion battery bonanza
But plenty more are closer to reality. Volkswagen took the wraps off yet another ID family member—the ID Roomzz joins the ID range alongside the Crozz, Buzz, Vizzion, and Buggy. A three-row SUV, this one goes on sale in 2021 and unlike the compact ID itself, we're pretty sure that includes the US market as well as Europe and Asia. It's not all SUVs, either. Though we keep hearing that time's up for the humble four-door, the evidence at Shanghai points to that idea being premature. Infiniti showed up with the Qs Inspiration. Unlike some of its recent EV concepts which have been pure flights of fancy, this too seems closer to reality. It's the automaker's take on an electric sedan. Nio—current record holder for the fastest electric lap of the Nurburgring—showed us its take on the form factor with the ET Preview. And Aston Martin brought an actual production car, the new Rapide E. It's much more practical than the Valkyrie hypercar, but it will sadly be almost as rare, with just 155 to be built. Speaking of hypercars, how does an all-new electric one from Lotus sound? Unfortunately, we have little to go on beyond the teaser sketch in the gallery above. In the past, I'd have caution skepticism, but the Norfolk-based car maker is now owned by Geely, and we've all seen how Volvo has flourished under its ownership.

""I do not think that Tesla knows everything [that goes on on Panasonic's side],"" one former employee who left the company last year said. ""It's impossible to know everything. If Elon Musk was to know what was truly going on, he would flip his lid."" Tesla and Panasonic share the Gigafactory, the massive manufacturing plant outside Reno, Nevada, built in 2016. At the Gigafactory, under the same roof, Panasonic makes cells for Tesla's cars, and then Tesla turns the cells into batteries for its new Model 3 sedan. Tesla also makes the drive units for the Model 3 there. Last week, Nikkei reported that Tesla and Panasonic would freeze plans to expand the Gigafactory. Tesla's stock fell, while Panasonic's rose after the news. Tesla responded by saying that both companies were still putting ""substantial funds"" into the Gigafactory, but that there's more ""output to be gained from improving existing production equipment."" Tesla CEO Elon Musk called Panasonic's production rate a ""constraint on Model 3 output"" that the company has known about since July. Three current and former employees, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Business Insider that the operation scraps roughly half a million cells each day. Business Insider reviewed internal company documents, including some related to an oil spill that sent management scrambling for weeks to find potentially contaminated cells. Together they tell a story of an operation that is still trying to get its bearings as batteries roll off the production line and into Model 3s. And just like on the Tesla side of the Gigafactory, there's intense pressure to meet production goals and work at breakneck speed. A Panasonic spokesperson replied to a list of Business Insider's detailed questions about these issues with the following statement: Panasonic produces the most advanced electric vehicle battery cells because we pay exceptional attention to quality. Our quality-control protocols are industry standards and include cleanroom environments and laboratory-like working conditions. The battery cells go through several testing gates before they are released to Tesla, and Tesla separately tests the cells after delivery. We are proud to have helped propel one of the most exciting revolutions in the auto industry. If you have any experience working with Tesla or Panasonic, email me at llopez@businessinsider.com. Markets Insider Quickly, here are a few very broad words on how lithium-ion batteries are made. The inside of the battery is made up of a sheet of a positively charged electrode (anode) and a sheet of a negatively charged electrode (cathode); there is a thin material separating the two. All of that rolled together makes the inside of a battery cell. Panasonic sends Tesla about 3 million battery cells daily, making this a massive operation that comes with all of what that entails — giant 16-foot-high mixers churning lithium and other chemicals, standard operating procedures meant to keep volatile ingredients clean, and a tracking system to follow materials as they go through the production process. It's an expensive operation too. Panasonic makes up the lion's share of Tesla's $18 billion worth of purchase obligations, $4.8 billion of which is due in 2019, according to Tesla company filings. The current and former employees told Business Insider that standard operating procedures often go ignored without consequence at the facility. On several occasions, something has fallen into one of the 16-foot mixers — which contain a blend of chemicals, including volatile lithium — inside the plant, three people with knowledge of the situation told Business Insider. That ""something"" — whether it be scissors, a roll of tape, a tool — is generally found when the mixer is being cleaned. ""People just don't have the integrity to say, 'Hey, I did something wrong,'"" one former employee said. Greg Less, the technical director of the University of Michigan Energy Institute's Battery Fabrication and Characterization User Facility, told Business Insider that if a piece of shrapnel got into the lithium mix, it could pierce the separator between the anode and cathode and cause a hard short. The shrapnel wouldn't have to be very big at all, either — a millimeter or half a millimeter — and it could be thin, the width of a human hair, or thinner, Less said. Conceivably, if the piece were long enough to pierce the separator and carry a current between the anode and cathode, it could cause a fire, he said. ""Having pieces of metal in your mix could cause real performance issues, not to mention damage your equipment,"" Less said. Read more: Wall Street is worried Tesla's going broke again In September, there was an oil spill that sent Panasonic's operation into crisis mode for about two weeks, Business Insider also learned. The spill was detected on September 17, according to internal documents viewed by Business Insider, but it's unclear exactly when it started. Mechanical oil got onto one of Panasonic's massive machines used to press cathode material into a sheet. The machine then contaminated any of the product it touched. Employees had to stop what they were doing and sift through millions of nearly finished battery cells to find potentially affected product, sources said. According to documents reviewed by Business Insider, as well as accounts from employees, Panasonic searched for product that had gone through the contaminated machine as far back as September 11. The search extended to the latest stages of the production process, and all the product that Panasonic suspected to be contaminated was scrapped, according to the internal documents and the employees. One current employee who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution told Business Insider they were concerned that Panasonic hadn't correctly pinpointed when the spill started. ""If my car is leaking oil, how am I going to know what day it started?"" the employee said. Mark Ellis, a senior associate at the manufacturing consultancy Munro and Associates, said an oil spill like this one would upset him ""tremendously"" because all the product would be ""automatic scrap."" ""You don't want contamination on the electrodes,"" he told Business Insider by phone. One current employee said they were concerned about contaminated cells because of Panasonic's tracking system on the factory floor. Would-be battery cells are tracked throughout the factory using a lot-number system. As they move from stage to stage of production, the number grows longer, and at every new stage of production a new piece of paper with that number and other details are printed and taped onto the product, according to the employees. The three current and former employees who spoke with Business Insider said that this paper often gets lost — the tape falls off or the paper rips. When that happens, workers will sometimes take a similar product's paper and use that to scan it down the line so that everything keeps moving without interruption. The people said that they worry that this practice, which is against the official procedure, hurts the traceability of the battery cells. Read more: Internal documents reveal Tesla is blowing through an insane amount of raw material and cash to make Model 3s, and production is still a nightmare Panasonic sends about 3 million battery cells over to Tesla a day, and the pressure is always on to beat previous goals. That is why, the employees told Business Insider, some workers inside the factory sometimes put tape over the sensors on machines that would catch defects. They don't want the production to stop. ""If I walked through a factory and saw tape on sensor, I'd be kicking ass,"" Ellis told Business Insider. Defects that are missed earlier in the process are often detected later down the line as product goes into the winding phase of production, in which the sheets are wound together as a cylinder. Panasonic's winding machines have dozens of sensors — too many for workers to tamper with. So the machines can find defects, including bad or expired material, dust, and misalignment. A Tesla spokesperson said that it conducts multiple tests on battery cells once they're received from Panasonic and that cells that don't make the cut are sent back to Panasonic. The winding phase is where much of the factory's scrap comes from — amounting to a fairly consistent half a million battery cells a day, one current and one former employee said. Employees start every shift with a departmental meeting, during which they're told about the previous shift's production and the number of cells scrapped. ""Why do we throw away half a million batteries a day? Because people are slobs and the stuff's not clean,"" the former employee said. All three current and former employees also said that rules for clean-room dressing often go ignored inside the factory. According to Ellis, winders should be running at 70 to 85% efficiency and shouldn't be catching much scrap at all. ""If the scrap was from the winders, I'd be going ballistic,"" he said. ""They've made cylindrical cells for decades. And if people can't make their machines do something they've been doing for decades, shame on them. They should be running at much higher efficiency than that."" A Panasonic spokesperson responded to Ellis' statement, saying that the company ""respectfully disagrees"" with his estimates and that they do not reflect the company's numbers. But both Less and Ellis said that the farther along a damaged product goes into the production process, the more money is wasted on labor, material, and the depreciation of equipment. ""That [scrap level] is really excessive. I would be kicking some ass big time if that were my factory,"" Ellis said. ""They obviously don't have all of their assembly processes under control. That's what would cause that."" If you have any experience working with Tesla or Panasonic, email me at llopez@businessinsider.com.

James is back with The Mister: JAN MOIR’s inimitable verdict,"It's been eight years since E.L. James (pictured above) released Fifty Shades of Grey Eight years since her first 50 Shades Of Grey bonk-buster was published, E.L. James is back with a new hero and heroine to entertain the millions hooked on her lucrative brand of panting mummy porn. It is time to say goodbye to handsome sadomasochistic American billionaire Christian Grey and the demure but captivatingly beautiful student Anastasia Steele, his willing accomplice throughout five torrid books and three terrible films. And it's time to say hello to 50 Shades Of Brit, in the form of handsome, sex-mad millionaire The Honourable Maxim Trevelyan, aka Lord Trevelyan, the 13th Earl of Trevethick, a green-eyed hunk with dimples on his bottom and a winning way with women. ('As you wish, I growl and thrust inside her'). He owns a 30,000 acre Cornish estate and 'a mop of unruly chestnut curls with gold highlights that glint beneath the magnificent chandelier in his hallway.' Not a euphemism, ladies, the author really does mean his lovely apartment in London. Maxim is the star of The Mister, E.L. James's new novel that takes us from the Chelsea Embankment to Cornwall to Albania and even — gasp — to Brentford, as the good lord pursues his demure but captivatingly beautiful Albanian cleaning lady, Alessia Demachi. New novel 'The Mister' charts the relationship between a man and his cleaner Along the way, James typically leaves no cliché unturned ('I smelled a rat') nor puckered nipple uncovered, although devoted fans of E.L. James's previous oeuvre might be rather disappointed. For while there is lots of sex in Mister, there are no gags, whips and only one single inventive use of a silken scarf. In this attempt to write a straightforward romance, James' spanking new protagonist is no spanker. In fact, there are no elements of BDSM (that's bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism to those unfamiliar with her genre) at all. Nor is there a Red Room of Pain, unless you count trying to crunch through the utterly deathly prose which is the author's trademark style, one which makes Dame Barbara Cartland seem like a literary genius. Let me give you a flavour of the horror. The first time Max meets Alessia he 'notices that her jeans are overwashed and her eyes are large and dark, like a startled doe'. Meanwhile, she is so shocked by his handsomeness that 'she clutches the handle of the broom to keep herself upright'. 'I am cleaner, Mister,' she says, while he thinks 'for a woman dressed in a nylon housecoat, she is hot'. Throughout the 30-odd chapters, the story switches from her perspective to his. As Alessia gets out her Windolene to clean the mirrors and drag Henry the Hoover around his penthouse, she admires Max's 'vivid green eyes, eyes the colour of the still, deep waters of the Drin on a summer's day'. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan in a scene from the Fifty Shades Freed which was released in 2018 Meanwhile, Maxim thinks she looks like 'an angel, possibly the Virgin Mary or a nun in blue'. She is a secret piano prodigy and chess mistress and goes around crying 'Zot!' a lot. He has already written a song for her and goes around crying 'f**k a duck' a lot. Is there much more of this to go? Oh God, only the 500 pages. Yet like Dame Agatha Christie, E.L. James is smart enough to give her readers what they want. With Christie it was a murder on the first page, plus a cavalcade of fruity suspects. With James, she returns once more to the perennial allure of a rich and powerful man falling for a beautiful but poor woman. For underneath the bondage of Fifty Shades lurked a very conventional romantic narrative. Anastasia was a strong and self-contained young woman, but one who still had inner doubts about herself and her attractiveness. She became a vehicle for the insecurities of millions of women who secretly harbour fantasies of being swept away from their humdrum lives by passion — and a wealthy lover. In The Mister, the author goes one step further, creating a marvellously preposterous aristocratic hero within her Cinderella in Downton Abbey storyline. Hi, I'm Maxim. My big brother died, did he commit suicide? Who knows, we never return to this theme again. I inherit the title Lord Trevelyan, but I remain humble. 'Blake,' I tell my butler, 'just call me sir.' I like sex but there are rules. 'Not in front of the staff,' says mater. Hang on, who is that beauty polishing my piano? I can see her pink pants through her nasty nylon pinnie. What a babe. I write a song for her. 'Mister, I clean?' she says. In the kitchen, I notice she irons my shirts with sensuous grace and long easy strokes. Excuse me I must go and take a shower. (Hi, I am Alessia. What does he see in me? I am only his cleaner.) Some bad guys try to kidnap her, I take her to Cornwall where she has never seen the sea. Her giggle is breathy, and it speaks directly to my groin. The shield from my family coat of arms perfectly mimics the Albanian flag — what are the chances? She has nothing and I have everything. And if I take advantage of her, what would that make me? Never mind, I peel off her Spongebob Squarepants pyjama bottoms and an old Arsenal t-shirt someone gave her because she has no clothes of her own. She is a 24-year-old virgin, so I must be gentle. How can I explain this without sounding pervy? Slowly I let her adjust to my intrusion. Will that do? (Hi Alessia here. How could I be so wanton? But Mister Maxim has woken a monster within me.) We make love a lot and gorge on ghastly meals. Bad men come. I beat them up. We make love. Again. Back in London Alessia and I declare our love but she gets kidnapped by a man her father promised her hand to in marriage. Ye gods. I fly to her parents' house in Kukes, Albania, for a showdown. Hope nobody makes me eat that lamby rice thing again. Betrothed guy tries to shoot me, but love conquers all. Alessia says she is pregnant, but she is not really. We have sex together again. I wouldn't mind some kids, I tell her. She teases my lips with her tongue. Put down that duster, love, I tell her. You've pulled. I'm the only Mr Muscle you'll be spraying from now on. The end.  Max may be a millionaire, but he doesn't have a sexual kink like Christian Grey. Bizarrely, we discover early on that his favourite biscuit is a plain chocolate digestive. He plays piano and guitar, composes scraps of music that express the void within his soul. He's also a DJ and a photographer who is also in demand as a hot model. Of course he is. Slender but curvaceous Alessia quickly becomes obsessed with his eyes, variously described as looking like the River Drin (see above), with 'irises a darker green around the edge like a fir, while towards the dilating pupil they are warmer, like a fern in spring'. They are also like a forest in spring and malachite, gottit? The Mister seethes with hints that the much mocked authoress wants to be taken seriously, as she plays with underlying themes of economic inequality and the plight of undocumented workers trafficked in from eastern Europe. Fair enough, but the tone is terrible. When Alessia wakes screaming in the night because of sex-trafficked memories, Max tells her: 'The next time you scream, I'll be right there.' He then thinks to himself: 'Of course, I'd like to make her scream in a different way.' What a creep. The worst bit? To make up for the lack of kink, E.L. James seems to have decided to use food as a handy conduit for arousal and I really wish she hadn't. By the time we get to chapter 15 Maxim and Alessia are having feasts before they tumble into bed together. First of all it is fish pie and beer in the pub, the following evening it is a pre-sex meal of beef and prune stew before some foreplay with the pudding afterwards. Let me say one thing, I'll never eat banoffee pie again. Then it's pulled pork with a pomegranate jus and worst of all, an Albanian dish of rice and lamb with a baked yoghurt crust, ugh. Purists and snobs — like me! — may mock James' writing style, but one can only admire her success. Her initial erotic trilogy sold more than 150 million copies worldwide and was translated into over 50 languages. Even her most devoted fans would probably admit the books were often clumsily written, teen-style fiction while the films that followed weren't much better, although they grossed more than $1 billion globally. In scenes filmed in full screen buttockorama, Dakota Johnson starred as Anastasia, while Jamie Dornan did his best as Christian Grey. Their lack of on-screen chemistry didn't help, but fans didn't seem to care, and flocked to the films anyway. What began as an exercise in escapism on her long, dreary Underground commute into London nine years ago has transformed James, 56, into one of the richest and most influential authors in the world. She's now said to be worth £114 million — a fortune generated not just by the books and films but the Fifty Shades merchandise, ranging from lingerie and jewellery to whips and bottles of wine, which the author herself personally helped to design. Not bad for a housewife, whose Northern Irish screenwriter husband Niall Leonard proofreads all her books and says he couldn't be further removed from his wife's fantasy creation. The couple have two grown-up sons, now 22 and 24, whom James also insists aren't remotely embarrassed by their mother's torrid imagination. Why would they be, one might wonder, when it has netted them a £2.7 million home in Ealing, a £1.1 million coastal home in Cornwall and a £5.5 million home in LA. Cars have also been an indulgence — James was the first person in the UK to buy a £60,000 red Tesla Model S electric sports car and also drives a blue 'Chelsea tractor' complete with a number plate ending 'SXY'. But, despite the baubles of success, James remains down to earth, equally at home with her new life in LA as she is her old life in West London. She continues to frequent her favourite pub in Ealing, where she goes to play Scrabble or simply for Sunday lunch with her family. And while she has become a fan of regular manicures and pedicures, she still has her hair blow-dried in Acton, does her own supermarket shopping and walks her two Westies, Max and Mini. She has also made vast donations to charity — according to her company records, in the region of £1.2 million to date. Now with the publication of The Mister, E.L. James is back doing what she loves most, writing torrents of boiling, erotic fiction in a world where eyes are always flashing, rolling, sparkling, flittering with lust or throbbing with passion. Has she given up on Christian Grey for ever? Note that Trevelyan was Christian's middle name. So perhaps not.",james back mister jan moir inimitable verdict,eight years since james pictured released fifty shades grey eight years since first shades grey published james back new hero heroine

Even if we blow everything on Earth to smithereens tomorrow, there will likely still be a library of 30,000 books, 5,000 languages, plus a complete copy of Wikipedia, somewhere on the moon. The only problem: We don't know exactly where. The library is a project of the Arch Foundation, the same company that gave Elon Musk a test copy of Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy to put aboard his spacebound Tesla Roadster. The Arch Lunar Library contains 100GB, or 30 million pages of text and pictures, literally embedded in 25 nickel disks in the tiniest type you can possibly imagine. You don't need anything more specialized than a microscope to read it, and the etchings should survive for billions of years. This library was supposed to be delivered to the surface of the moon — specifically, the Sea of Serenity — by Israel's Beresheet Mission last week. The bad news: After a glitch that turned its engine off and on again at the worst possible moment, the Beresheet lander smashed into the moon at 300 miles per hour. The good news: Those disks were designed to be indestructible. And the Arch Foundation is all but certain its payload survived the crash. “We have either installed the first library on the moon,"" says Arch Mission co-founder Nova Spivack, ""or we have installed the first archaeological ruins of early human attempts to build a library on the moon."" Some other items in that library for future alien archeologists to pore over: David Copperfield's magic secrets, the Bible, an Israeli time capsule, and a queso recipe from a cafe in Texas. The Foundation isn't giving up on its lost moon library — and it wants your help in locating it. Spivack's team has put together an open Google Doc with all the technical specs of the library alongside all details of the crash provided by SpaceIL, the Israeli nonprofit behind Beresheet. (SpaceIL collaborated with aerospace manufacturer Israel Aerospace Industries and Israel Space Agency, Israel's NASA, on the lander.) It's a math problem, basically, though one unlike any you ever encountered in school: If a spacecraft carrying a 100 gram object crashes on the moon at 300 miles an hour, how far away will that object land? Already one aerospace engineer has suggested that the impact crater should be large enough for the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to spot — though it's unlikely to be able to pick out anything as tiny as the little library that could. SpaceIL has already announced that a second Beresheet mission will be attempted, perhaps with another library on board.  In the meantime, as Spivack notes, ""when you look at the Moon from now on, realize there is a lost library there containing Wikipedia, 30,000 books, 5,000 languages, and the history of the world."" Not to mention a recipe for some pretty good queso.",may copy wikipedia somewhere moon help find,ever worried humanity ever wipe completely record civilization aliens discover rest somewhat easy even blow everything earth smithereens tomorrow likely still library books languages plus complete copy wikipedia somewhere moon problem know exactly library project arch foundation company gave elon musk test copy isaac asimov foundation trilogy put aboard spacebound tesla roadster arch lunar library contains million pages text pictures literally embedded nickel disks tiniest type possibly imagine need anything specialized microscope read etchings survive billions years library supposed delivered surface moon specifically sea serenity israel beresheet mission last week bad news glitch turned engine worst possible moment beresheet lander smashed moon miles per hour good news disks designed indestructible arch foundation certain payload survived crash either installed first library moon says arch mission nova spivack installed first archaeological ruins early human attempts build library moon items library future alien archeologists pore david copperfield magic secrets bible israeli time capsule queso recipe cafe texas foundation giving lost moon library wants help locating spivack team put together open google doc technical specs library alongside details crash provided spaceil israeli nonprofit behind beresheet spaceil collaborated aerospace manufacturer israel aerospace industries israel space agency israel nasa lander math problem basically though one unlike ever encountered school spacecraft carrying gram object crashes moon miles hour far away object land already one aerospace engineer suggested impact crater large enough nasa lunar reconnaissance orbiter spot though unlikely able pick anything tiny little library could spaceil already announced second beresheet mission attempted perhaps another library board meantime spivack notes look moon realize lost library containing wikipedia books languages history world mention recipe pretty good queso

The two-row Corsair continues Lincoln's strategy of leaning into what it considers its new brand identity: plush, spacious, and quiet vehicles that offer smooth rides and new technology. It is the smallest SUV Lincoln makes, but Lincoln President Joy Falotico said the vehicle competes in one of the fastest growing segments in the market. Ford's luxury brand has not released any pricing information yet, but the vehicle is likely to cost less than the next-larger SUV, the Nautilus, which starts at around $40,000. Despite the Corsair's relatively small size, Lincoln said it is taking the idea of spaciousness seriously: the company said the car has more rear seat legroom than larger SUVs such as the Tesla Model X and the Mercedes-Benz GLS. Lincoln is also playing up the vehicle's smooth ride, made possible by a new suspension system and a part-time all-wheel drive system that adjusts to road and weather conditions. The Corsair comes with either a 2.0 liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that makes 250 horsepower and a 2.3 liter turbo four that makes 280 hp. Both engines come with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Lincoln does have plans to electrify the vehicle, confirmed Falotico. There will be a plug-in hybrid version, which Lincoln expects will have longer range than the plug-in hybrid version of the similarly-sized Ford Escape. Lincoln expects the plug-in version will be available within the first year of the vehicle's production. Meanwhile, Lincoln is working on an all-electric version, but has to sort out the technical issues. The all-electric will likely be laid out in a skateboard platform, similar to those found on Tesla vehicles, where the batteries and key electrical components are located in or under the car's floor. Lincoln has not decided whether the plug-in version will be performance-focused, as is the case with the hybrid version of the larger Aviator. Lincoln is also loading the car with high-tech features, such as a system that allows users to operate the car with their phones instead of keys, similar to the system found on cars such as the Tesla Model 3. There are also small details, such as a range of colors for the cabin's ambient lighting system, and door chimes developed with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, which the company began offering with the mid-size Aviator SUV. The premium subsidiary of Ford Motor Co. has been rehabilitating its image and trying to reconnect with buyers in recent years. The company cut its name as the maker of stylish and quintessentially American sedans like the Continental in the 1960s. It did the same for high-end SUVs in the 1990s with the Navigator. In more recent decades, however, Lincoln was considered an ""also-ran"" that ditched its roots and mistakenly tried to compete with other luxury makers, especially those from Germany and Japan. But Lincoln had a hit in the redesigned Navigator full-size SUV in 2018, and is rolling out several more similar vehicles in various sizes and price points. The Corsair also will be Lincoln's first vehicle made in China for the Chinese market, a big step for the company. Lincoln is something of a bright spot for Ford in China. Overall, the second-largest automaker has long struggled in China. Total Ford China sales fell more than 36% in 2018, but Lincoln grew 2.2%. So far all of the Lincolns sold in China have been imports. Building the Corsair locally will be a crucial next step for the overall business, and will allow Lincoln to take advantage of cost savings and local expertise in certain areas, Falotico said. For example, the Chinese market is moving rapidly ahead in infotainment systems and in-cabin technology. Lincoln can take lessons from the market in that country and bring them back to the U.S. customer as it tries to forge ahead with its renaissance at home. ""Lincoln is betting on a familiar formula with the Corsair, but that's not necessarily a bad thing,"" said Edmunds analyst Jessica Caldwell. ""Slow and steady wins the race, and cranking out a stable of stylish SUVs with actual names shoppers can identify isn't a bad way to build a brand right now. If Lincoln continues to build the types of vehicles shoppers want with a focus on style and quality, it has a real shot at a comeback.""

Long-term, this reduces the battery's longevity, and Tesla cars actually charge up to 90% by default. But if you're pressed for range, should you change this and charge up to 100%? Well, unless you absolutely must squeeze every bit of range out of your battery, the answer is still no. It's not just about battery degradation. In a recent Twitter exchange, Tesla CEO Elon Musk explained that regenerative braking does not kick in at full charge, meaning the car is less energy efficient. A Tesla Model 3 owner asked Musk whether she should charge up to 100%, given her commute is a total of 160 miles, which leaves little wiggle room to do much else with the car without a recharge. Her Model 3 is the Standard Range Plus variety, which has 240 miles of range at full battery capacity, but this drops to about 216 miles at the default 90% charge setting. Musk's answer is that she should still charge to 90% or 95%, to reap the full benefit of regenerative braking. Regenerative braking is the tech that turns braking energy into electricity, extending the car's range by re-felling the battery. Its effectiveness varies by a number of factors, but there are reports of it extending a Tesla's range by as much as 30%. So charging the battery to 95% might actually be almost as good, range-wise, as charging to 100%. To know exactly how close the numbers get, one would have to know when, exactly, regenerative braking kicks in. I've pinged Musk for the answer and will update the article if I get it, but anecdotal evidence from Tesla forums suggests that it happens when the battery is anywhere from 84% to 94% capacity, so roughly in line with what Musk had said — but ambient temperature is also a factor, so your mileage (literally) may vary. These types of tricks will likely become common knowledge as electric cars get more popular, but now they're still exotic to many users who are used to filling the car up to the max. But electric battery-powered cars offer many advantages that ICE cars don't — regenerative braking being one of them — and the sooner we learn to reap the full benefits, the better.",elon musk explains charge tesla battery,electric car batteries generally charged reduces battery longevity tesla cars actually charge default pressed range change charge well unless absolutely must squeeze every bit range battery answer still battery degradation recent twitter exchange tesla ceo elon musk explained regenerative braking kick full charge meaning car less energy efficient tesla model owner asked musk whether charge given commute total miles leaves little wiggle room much else car without recharge model standard range plus variety miles range full battery capacity drops miles default charge setting musk answer still charge reap full benefit regenerative braking regenerative braking tech turns braking energy electricity extending car range battery effectiveness varies number factors reports extending tesla range much charging battery might actually almost good charging know exactly close numbers get one would know exactly regenerative braking kicks pinged musk answer update article get anecdotal evidence tesla forums suggests happens battery anywhere capacity roughly line musk said ambient temperature also factor mileage literally may vary types tricks likely become common knowledge electric cars get popular still exotic many users used filling car max electric cars offer many advantages ice cars regenerative braking one sooner learn reap full benefits better

The script will be different behind the scenes,"“We’re excited to compete,” declared Netflix in response to the rivals preparing to take it on. Translation: Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap. The streaming kingpin has a squadron of tanks moving on to its lawn. Disney, Apple, Warner, insert name of giant media company wanting to join the streaming party. In between are niche players, like ITV and the the BBC with their feisty little cut price Brit Box. But don’t you worry your sweet little heads, said Netflix while unveiling its latest quarterly update. “We don’t anticipate that these new entrants will materially affect our growth.” Co founder and CEO Reed Hastings’ reasoning seems to be that if he acts chilled then his shareholders will too. For the most part it seems to have worked. Wall Street was a little restive over the outlook for subscriber growth in the wake of the price rises the company has pushed through in some markets (including its US home). But Netflix had a very good quarter, topping expectations and welcoming 9.6m new customers. The birthday cake was brought home and while next week's party might not be quite as fancy as some of the guests had hoped it’ll still be a blast. You investors, you have nothing to worry about because “the transition from linear to on demand entertainment is so massive and because of the differing nature of our content offering”. There’s nothing like some good old fashioned corporate gobbledygook to reassure people that everything’s just fine ’n’ dandy . Behind the scenes I imagine it’s a different story. If you’re a long term holder of the stock you’d certainly hope so. Netflix has been living on easy street for a remarkably long time, and my how it has capitalised on that. But its surprisingly slow to join in the fun rivals have now woken up and they have the capacity to make it sweat. Disney, Apple and Amazon (which is beefing up its Prime offer) boast a combined market value of in excess of $2tn (£1.5tn). That’s a lot of clout. Disney, in particular, also has content and recently bought out the AT&T owned Warner’s minority stake in Hulu, a US based streaming service perhaps best known for the Handmaid’s Tale. The others can pay for it, and Amazon has done for its hugely expensive Lord of the Rings prequel. Part of the reason for those Netflix price rises is to fund more of its own shows and films. It’s heaven for creators and consumers could be left starry eyed.

But according to a new study from the University of Oxford and Cancer Research UK, even sticking within government guidelines can increase your risk significantly. The study, published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, found that people who eat 76g of red or processed meat per day have a 20% higher risk of developing bowel cancer than those who averaged 21g a day. The research team analyzed the diets of nearly half a million British men and women aged 40 to 69. They were followed over five years, and in that time 2,609 developed bowel cancer. While about one in 15 men and one in 18 women are expected to be diagnosed with bowel cancer in their lifetime, the results of the study found this risk rose 20% with every extra 25g of processed meat. The risk was heightened with red meat too, by 19% per 50g — about a slice of roast beef. Cancer expert Tim Key, a coauthor of the study, said the results strongly suggest people who eat red and processed meat more than four times a week have a higher risk of bowel cancer. ""There's substantial evidence that red and processed meat are linked to bowel cancer, and the World Health Organisation classifies processed meat as carcinogenic and red meat as probably carcinogenic,"" he said. ""But most previous research looked at people in the 1990s or earlier, and diets have changed significantly since then, so our study gives a more up-to-date insight that is relevant to meat consumption today."" Read more: Eating even a little bit of processed meat regularly can increase your risk of some deadly cancers The head of health information at Cancer Research UK, Julie Sharp, said the study should serve as a reminder that you can always improve your health beyond simply following government guidelines. ""This doesn't necessarily mean cutting out red and processed meat entirely, but you may want to think about simple ways to reduce how much you have and how often,"" she said. ""Although breaking habits we've had for a long time can be hard, it's never too late to make healthy changes to our diet."" For instance, she suggested meat-free Mondays, and trying more recipes using filling ingredients such as fish, beans, and lentils. There are benefits of red meat. It's full of iron and protein, and can be part of a healthy, balanced diet. But ingredients in processed meat can be carcinogenic, especially if it is smoked or barbecued.

Plus ca change, you might very well say. While the Office for National Statistics recorded a fractional rise (0.6 per cent) for the UK as a whole in February when compared to last year, with several regions recording impressive growth, the capital took a 3.8 per cent tumble. You have to look back to 2009, when its financial centre was reeling from the after shocks of the financial crisis, to find a similarly rapid rate of decline. Such monthly figures are inevitably choppy, but the way it has accelerated is also notable. The ONS reported a 2.2 per cent fall in January. Another crisis, Brexit, inevitably had an influence on the behaviour of this unique market where the presence of the City and lots of foreign investors pushes prices up and distorts things. To what extent is open to debate. The threat of a no deal crash out was acute in February but in much of the country the reaction to this has ranged from “they won’t let it happen” to “it won’t be as bad as they say”. That might help to explain why the North West, for example, recorded growth of 4 per cent. They aren't quite so blasé in the square mile, where an appreciation of the negative impact of Britain falling off the no deal cliff is acute and where people see colleagues departing for the continent every day as businesses vote with their feet. Is this why buyers in the capital - and the South East where similar factors play a role - pressed the pause button to the extent that they did? There is another theory, namely that the affordability of properties in these regions is now so stretched that a correction was inevitable. Andrew Goodwin, associate director at Oxford Economics, sees this as principle cause, and thinks it, and the current low level of transactions, could keep prices in a rut for some time. Both may ultimately have played a role. The figures for March and April could provide some clarity as to which played the biggest.

""We are upgrading the QCOM shares based on a surprise announcement today that Qualcomm has reached an out of court settlement with Apple. Based on Qualcomm management's projection of $2.00/share earnings increase once iPhones ramp into production with Qualcomm modems inside, we believe there is no or only a slight discount to Qualcomm's licensing fee. In our view, Apple made the concession based on the need to have a 5G iPhone in the market in 2020. Also, in our view, this may signal that Intel's 5G modem may not be production-ready in 2020. Our 12-month target price is now $100 based on 16x FY20E non-GAAP EPS. "" Evercore ISI says Qualcomm shares are finally ""investable"" again after the company settled its legal dispute with Apple. ""Our prior price target of $60 reflected 13.5x normalized FY20 EPS. Assuming the same multiple on the higher anticipated earnings into FY21, we raise our price target to $90 and upgrade the stock to Outperform. Moreover, with litigation likely mostly behind us coupled with clear visibility to 5G ramp, QCOM shares are finally investable again."" J.P. Morgan upgraded the stock saying it now had ""strong 5G positioning."" ""While waiting for further details on Qualcomm's May 1 earnings call, our preliminary math indicates that royalty payments on an ongoing basis on a per iPhone basis are unlikely to be materially different from Qualcomm's licensing rate for SEPs, and points to potentially only modest headwinds (if at all) from offering the same licensing rate to other OEMs. Additionally, the agreement opens up the opportunity to resume chipset supply to Apple, ranging from a sizeable market share on iPhone units in the (Sep) 2020 models to an upside opportunity from capturing a primary position on the device if competitors are unable to deliver a 5G chipset. We are upgrading QCOM shares on combination of upside driven by 5G leadership and dissipation of downside risks from litigations following this agreement. "" Bernstein said the company is making progress in transformation with a new CEO and management. ""Tiffany's brand equity seems stronger than that of its USA soft luxury peers, as it has: a) a more prominent position in its category; b) a tighter control on distribution with virtually 100% retail exposure; c) limited exposure to the off-price. These elements converge to make Tiffany a more structurally appealing brand long-term. "" Jefferies said negative EPS revisions could be a ""weight"" on the stock. ""We downgrade BAC to Hold, given negative EPS revisions (our '20 down 3%) and not enough upside to warrant a Buy rating. After a very strong 4Q18 result, the 1Q19 print showed incremental challenges in numerous revenue areas. This spans both net int. income (higher deposit costs, less asset-side repricing) and fees (card fees, services charges tougher, adding to the well-known capital markets-related dips).

""Reiterate Outperform rating and lowering price target to $400.

While we are recalibrating our expectations, we continue to expect shares will outperform over time as TSLA introduces innovative products, increases profitability, and generates free cash flow. "" UBS downgraded the PayPal mostly on valuation. ""Downgrade reflects limited EPS from core operations or Venmo in 2019-20 Our downgrade to Neutral reflects three factors: 1) Our EPS sensitivity analysis on PayPal's core operations indicates limited beat-and-raise potential over a two-year horizon, and our bull scenario for Venmo monetization would only add 2% to our current 2020E EPS. 2) While the UBS Evidence Lab P2P Spend Tracker survey data indicates that Venmo maintains a leading competitive position in P2P payments, we estimate this competitive position will translate into limited revenue and net income contribution over the next two years, even in a bullish monetization scenario. And 3) Limited valuation upside: we're raising our price target to $120 which reflects $13 for Venmo and $107 for PayPal ex-Venmo, which maintains core PayPal's premium to peers and historical levels. "" Susquehanna said it has concerns about industry dynamics and Lyft's position as the No. 2 player. ""We like LYFT's service and large and growing TAM, but intermediate- to long-term competitive and industry dynamics worry us. LYFT clearly has built one of the leading ridesharing services in the US and operates in a very large and growing market. However, we're worried about the competitive dynamics of being the #2 player in a market where scale is extremely important, and switching costs for riders and drivers are relatively low and barriers to entry – while they exist – aren't insurmountable, especially for larger scaled US and international Internet companies.

""We initiate coverage of Cronos, a Canada based cannabis company, with an Underperform rating and C$17/US$13 price objectives, on 23x our CY20e EV/sales and backed by our detailed valuation framework. Cronos is a compelling fundamental story in our view, but we are unable to get comfortable with valuation. "" Longbow downgraded the stock mostly on valuation. ""The shares of SHAK are up approximately 25% since November, due in part to the company's reported modest comparable sales beat for 4Q18 in late February. • Looking ahead, we remain positive on the company fundamentals. In the near term, we are confident SHAK's can generate at least modestly positive same-store sales growth over the next 12-18 months based largely on the simple fact that the company's base of comp stores will continue to expand outside of the NYC region. In the long term, new store productivity and unit expansion represent the heart of SHAK's long-term growth story and each quarter of better than expected new store AUV generate gives us greater confidence the concept can succeed outside of its home NYC market.

""Despite volatility around all things housing in 4Q18, after visiting 200+ communities to date, we think 2019 has evolved into a classic spring season for both demand and the stocks. Demand began improving around mid-February and by our checks indicate that momentum has generally continued to improve into April. Even markets that were called out as particularly soft in 4Q18, like Inland Empire and Dallas, have rebounded to a varying degree since last year. Most markets saw heavy incentives in December and January, but it appears that most markets and builders have been pulling back on this front as spring has progressed / demand has re-emerged. The stock market has responded accordingly – the ITB is up ~25% YTD at press time, and is also up ~25% since November 15th of last year. We make this point as historically, we see the November 15th to April 15th window as the bulk of the spring trade, and historically the spring trade is worth ~20% to the group on average.

Scientists have been observing mice in space since 2014 to better understand how astronauts might be affected when they spend longer periods of time in the so-called microgravity environment, NASA said in its report. As the agency prepares to send astronauts on lengthy journeys to the Moon or Mars, it is testing conditions on rodents, because they have similar body systems to humans. In the latest study, researchers filmed the mice in microgravity for 37 days, and compared the recording to mice's behavior on Earth. In terms of a mouse's lifespan, this is considered a longterm mission.  The images showed that the rodents continued eating, grooming, cuddling, and exploring just as they would on Earth. The only difference was that they adapted these behaviors to a weightless environment. Instead of standing on their back legs to explore their surroundings, for example, they held on to the cage walls with their hind limbs or tails. Some of the younger mice in the study developed a new behavior described as ""race-tracking,"" where they ran laps around the cage, according to NASA. Scientists are still researching why they started this new activity — a possible reason could be that they were trying to stimulate their balance system which they barely need in microgravity. The mice on this mission were the first to be put in a habitat called the Rodent Hardware System, which allowed them grab things and run. Allowing the rodents to move around the same way an astronaut would is important because it allows NASA to examine the effects of microgravity on bone loss, for example, NASA said. April Ronca, a NASA researcher and lead author in the study, said even just observing their behavior can be useful. ""Behavior is a remarkable representation of the biology of the whole organism,"" she said in the report.""It informs us about overall health and brain function.""

The moves provide fresh evidence of Apple's renewed ambitions to enter the autonomous vehicle derby, an effort it calls Project Titan. The talks are focused on next-generation lidar, a sensor that provides a three-dimensional look at the road. Apple is seeking lidar units that would be smaller, cheaper and more easily mass produced than current technology, the three people said. The iPhone maker is setting a high bar with demands for a ""revolutionary design,"" one of the people familiar with the talks said. The people declined to name the companies Apple has approached. The sensor effort means Apple wants to develop the entire chain of hardware to guide autonomous vehicles and has joined automakers and investors in the race to find winning technologies. Current lidar systems, including units from Velodyne mounted on Apple's fleet of self-driving test vehicles, use laser light pulses to render precise images of the environment around the car. But the systems can cost $100,000 and use mechanical parts to sweep the laser scanners across the road. That makes them too bulky and prone to failure for use in mass-produced vehicles. The shortcomings have spurred $1 billion in investment at dozens of startups and mature companies alike to make lidar smaller, cheaper and more robust. Apple's interest in next-generation lidar sensors comes as it has sharply increased its road testing while bringing on key hires from Tesla and Alphabet's Google. It remains unclear whether the goal of Apple's Project Titan is to build its own vehicle or supply the hardware and software elements of self-driving car while pairing with a partner for the entire vehicle. But what is clear from Apple's interest in cheaper lidar systems is that it wants to control the ""perception stack"" of sensors, computers and software to drive an autonomous vehicle, regardless of who makes the vehicle, another person familiar with the talks said. The three people familiar with the talks declined to be identified because the discussions are not public. In addition to evaluating potential outside suppliers, Apple is believed to have its own internal lidar sensor under development, two of the people said. Alphabet-owned Waymo has taken a similar path, assembling a sensor and computer system while inking deals to buy vehicles from Fiat Chrysler. Apple gets ""a lot of optionality by working on the perception stack,"" said the second person familiar with the talks. ""Bringing a passenger car to the market is really, really hard, and there's no reason right now they need to jump into it."" The designs Apple is seeking could potentially be made with conventional semiconductor manufacturing techniques, all four people familiar with the talks said. That has the potential to lower prices from the many thousands to the hundreds of dollars as the sensors are produced in larger numbers, similar to chips in phones and other devices. Apple also wants sensors that can see several hundred yards down the road. The long-distance requirement shows Apple is interested in fully self-driving vehicles, versus the more limited features such as adaptive cruise control used today, two people familiar with the matter said. ""They're not happy with most of what they see,"" the first person familiar with the matter said. ""They're looking for a revolutionary design."" A third person familiar with the matter said Apple is seeking a ""design-oriented"" sensor that would be sleek and unobtrusive enough to fit into the overall lines of a vehicle. Apple declined to comment. Apple once investigated building its own vehicle. The company had a team of more than a dozen engineers dedicated to detailed work such as ensuring doors closed quietly instead of slamming shut, a fourth person briefed on the matter said. Apple last year re-hired Doug Field, an Apple veteran who was serving as Tesla's engineering chief, to work on Project Titan. The project has about 1,200 people, according to a count in court documents. Field has been putting his stamp on the effort, laying off about 190 workers but also bringing on key hires such as Michael Schwekutsch, who oversaw electric drive train technology at Telsa. Apple also ramped up its testing miles in California, driving nearly 80,000 last year compared to 800 the year before.",apple talks sensors could hint building car,apple held talks least four companies possible suppliers lidar sensors cars evaluating companies technology also still working lidar unit three people familiar discussions said moves provide fresh evidence apple renewed ambitions enter autonomous vehicle derby effort calls project titan talks focused lidar sensor provides look road apple seeking lidar units would smaller cheaper easily mass produced current technology three people said iphone maker setting high bar demands revolutionary design one people familiar talks said people declined name companies apple approached sensor effort means apple wants develop entire chain hardware guide autonomous vehicles joined automakers investors race find winning technologies current lidar systems including units velodyne mounted apple fleet test vehicles use laser light pulses render precise images environment around car systems cost use mechanical parts sweep laser scanners across road makes bulky prone failure use vehicles shortcomings spurred billion investment dozens startups mature companies alike make lidar smaller cheaper robust apple interest lidar sensors comes sharply increased road testing bringing key hires tesla alphabet google remains unclear whether goal apple project titan build vehicle supply hardware software elements car pairing partner entire vehicle clear apple interest cheaper lidar systems wants control perception stack sensors computers software drive autonomous vehicle regardless makes vehicle another person familiar talks said three people familiar talks declined identified discussions public addition evaluating potential outside suppliers apple believed internal lidar sensor development two people said waymo taken similar path assembling sensor computer system inking deals buy vehicles fiat chrysler apple gets lot optionality working perception stack said second person familiar talks bringing passenger car market really really hard reason right need jump designs apple seeking could potentially made conventional semiconductor manufacturing techniques four people familiar talks said potential lower prices many thousands hundreds dollars sensors produced larger numbers similar chips phones devices apple also wants sensors see several hundred yards road requirement shows apple interested fully vehicles versus limited features adaptive cruise control used today two people familiar matter said happy see first person familiar matter said looking revolutionary design third person familiar matter said apple seeking sensor would sleek unobtrusive enough fit overall lines vehicle apple declined comment apple investigated building vehicle company team dozen engineers dedicated detailed work ensuring doors closed quietly instead slamming shut fourth person briefed matter said apple last year doug field apple veteran serving tesla engineering chief work project titan project people according count court documents field putting stamp effort laying workers also bringing key hires michael schwekutsch oversaw electric drive train technology telsa apple also ramped testing miles california driving nearly last year compared year

The event kicked off with Nikola CEO Trevor Milton arriving on stage on a Budweiser Clydesdale in honour of the company's contract with Anheuser-Busch, which ordered 800 hydrogen-electric semi-trucks last year for its beer-carrying fleet -- a major coup in the company's ongoing rivalry with Tesla. First on show was the Nikola Reckless, a military all-terrain autonomy-compatible vehicle that boasts an almost non-existent sound and heat signature, as well as modular functionality and, as an added bonus, a 13-inch infotainment screen that can be entirely submerged in water without damage.  Next up was Nikola's Water Adventure Vehicle (WAV), an all-electric jet-ski style personal watercraft, followed by the NZT (""net zero toll"") Off-Highway Vehicle. This flagship sports vehicle has all the markings of a powerful off-road dune buggy (590 horsepower no less) with a luxury finish. The cabin is completely sealed off from the elements, so you won't have to worry about getting sweaty or sandy as you rev from 0 to 60 miles per hour in four seconds for a full battery range of 150 miles. This is a beefy toy that doesn't come cheap, though -- when it goes into production in 2021 it'll come with a starting price of $80,000. Then finally, the moment everyone had been waiting for, the big rigs. The Nikola Two and the Europe-bound Nikola Tre Class 8 semis that were unveiled were both hydrogen electric versions, but battery-only electric models of both will be available once they go into production. With a range of up to 750 miles and hydrogen fuelling in under 15 minutes, the Tre is expected to make a major impact on long-haul goods transportation. According to Nikola, the company currently has more than 13,000 trucks on order. While its military ATV, watercraft and off-road vehicle demonstrate what the business is capable of, its focus is cargo, and this is where the company will have the biggest impact in realizing a world free of transport-based emissions. If Nikola's 800-truck deal with Anheuser-Busch is the equivalent of taking 13,000 cars off the road, it's not hard to see the meaningful impact that 13,000 even newer and more efficient trucks will make.

Forget about that Tesla—the Jaguar I-Pace is the most compelling EV yet
NEW YORK—On Wednesday morning, the Jaguar I-Pace won this year's World Car of the Year award at the 2019 New York International Auto Show. It beat two other finalists, the Audi e-tron and Volvo's S60 and V60 twins to top honors, as voted by a panel of 86 journalists from around the world. Disclosure: for the second year in a row, I was one of those judges. We were asked to score each eligible car on a range of attributes, including safety, the environment, performance, design, and value, but only for vehicles we actually drove. You can see the list of eligible vehicles for this year's awards here. (Sorry, Tesla fans: the Model 3 is really rather good but went on sale too long ago to be considered for this year's awards.) I'm not surprised that the I-Pace won; as a battery electric vehicle it scored highly on its green credentials, it's a joy to drive, and it looks stunning inside and out. Much of that can be said about the Volvos and the Audi, but if I had a place to charge it and I could afford one, the I-Pace would be my pick to replace our now-totaled Saabaru. (I don't, can't, and my wife gets to pick the next car anyway.) The Audi and Jaguar were also contenders for the World Green Car award, joined by the Hyundai Nexo hydrogen fuel cell car. It also really impressed me with a great interior and a calming driving style despite my continued skepticism for hydrogen as a fuel. I've repeatedly complained that it's taking the industry too long to get real about alternative powertrains, but the fact that two-thirds of the ""green"" cars were also finalists for the big trophy should be grounds for some optimism. In fact, as the Volvos are available as plug-in hybrid EVs, all three of the WCOTY finalists can be driven to the shops and back without burning a drop of gasoline. In the end, the I-Pace scored more highly than the Audi or Hyundai, and it also took home a trophy for World Car Design of the Year, making it a good morning for Jaguar's BEV. ""Electrification's given us the option to do something quite unique and quite different. And I think it's something people like,"" said Ian Callum, head of design at Jaguar. Further Reading
McLaren knocks it out of the park again with the 720S Spider convertible
Our first-hand experience in the other categories is more limited. The McLaren 720S took World Performance Car, and rightly so. McLaren has been developing and refining its carbon-fiber supercar platform with each successive iteration, and the 720S improves on its predecessor in just about every way. Audi's first BEV might not have brought home a trophy, but the brand took first prize in the World Luxury Car award with the new A7. I didn't actually get any seat time in an A7 until earlier this month, so the full review is still in the queue, but it's definitely my favorite internal combustion powered car in the German OEM's line-up. I'm not sure any car captured as many hearts this year as the Suzuki Jimny, 2019's World Urban Car. It's not even on sale in the US, but Suzuki cleverly brought one to last year's WCOTY's test drive in Los Angeles for jurors to try. I wasn't there so I didn't try out the diminutive off-roader, and I confess I still don't really get it. The only finalist I have tried was the new Kia Soul, which did quite well on the snowy roads of San Diego.

The company seems to be positioning itself as the ""trucker's Tesla,"" serving up Budweiser (supplied by partner-customer Anheuser-Busch) and country music to the same industry watchers and investors that Tesla usually courts. Of the five products that Nikola CEO Trevor Milton talked about on Tuesday night, very little came as a true surprise to watchers of the company. There were two trucks: the Nikola Two and the Nikola Tre (for European markets), as well as a Utility Task Vehicle (UTV) for off-roading, a military-grade UTV, and a previously unannounced jet ski. Trucks The most important of these debuts were the trucks: Milton admitted later in a private discussion with the press that truck sales would make up the bulk of Nikola's business and revenues. Back in 2016, Nikola announced its Nikola One truck, promising that by 2020 it would have a truck for sale with 1,200 miles of range from a combination battery pack charged by a hydrogen fuel cell.

Now, the Nikola One has been sidelined by the Nikola Two, which appears to be a better fit for actual commercialization: its powertrain can be made with a battery bank for all-electric operation, or it can be made with a hydrogen-powered fuel cell that constantly regenerates a smaller battery. Although the new commercialization date is 2022, Milton said last night that Nikola is on track to meet that deadline. Nikola says the fuel-cell version of this truck will have 500 to 750 miles of range, which is on the upper limit of what a person can drive in one stretch anyway. Refueling the hydrogen truck will take just 15 minutes at any of the 700 hydrogen refueling stations that Nikola has promised to build. (We assume the company will have more to say on hydrogen fuel Wednesday, when it's scheduled to host a second talk given by its vice president of hydrogen technology, Jesse Schneider. Nel Hydrogen, a European supplier of renewable hydrogen manufacturing equipment, will also present.) The all-battery powertrain does not have a specific range yet, but the trucks will likely be sold to freight companies who want zero-carbon options for their shorter-haul operations. Speaking to press, Milton said that Nikola decided to offer an all-battery option for its trucks so that the company could fit any route. ""Weight is so important in the trucking world; every pound is worth 50 cents,"" Milton said. But, he added, as batteries get more efficient over the next several years, the balance between battery weight and fuel cell weight might even out over time. Milton said twice last night that he expects hydrogen fuel cell trucks to make up 80 percent of the company's truck orders and all-battery trucks to make up the other 20 percent. ""The powertrain of the truck, whether it's hydrogen or electrical, is identical,"" Milton said, adding that customers can order trucks with hydrogen as a fuel, or they can order trucks with a 500, 750, or 1,000 kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery pack. An efficiency figure for those batteries was not disclosed, nor did the company say who would be supplying the battery packs. As is common these days, Nikola says that all of its trucks will have hardware for full level-four or level-five autonomy. Still, the most important thing to come out of last night was the presence of actual demonstration trucks, which will be driving around a convention center track for spectators today. The company has faced criticism for talking big without proof that it can actually make a truck, so offering concrete evidence of Nikola's seriousness is important. Though these trucks have been in development for three years, Milton has pushed a ""revolutionary"" narrative, saying on stage last night that ""one of my requirements was that none of my engineers came from an existing trucking company,"" because established trucking engineers are ""in an environment where they're taught to do a certain thing in a certain way, to make it incrementally better."" ""But I didn't want to make it incrementally better,"" the CEO said. Powersports Nikola has been giving rides in its demonstration UTV, called the Nikola NZT, for at least a year, and at first glance it looks like little has changed. The vehicle has a battery pack that gives it 150 miles of range. It has four motors with Bosch-provided eAxle control, which Ars wrote about in 2017. Nikola gave Ars a spin in its NZT last year in Michigan, promising production would begin this year. Now, commercialization has been pushed back to 2021, a year before the Nikola Two is scheduled to go to market. Nikola has already been taking reservations for its NZT. Last night Nikola also showed off the Reckless, a military-grade UTV, which appears to be a heavier-duty extension of the NZT. Company representatives noted that the Reckless' advantages are primarily in stealth. The UTV makes less noise compared to a diesel-powered UTV, it has almost no heat signature (especially if it's operated in either the remote-control or autonomous modes, without a human in the passenger seat), and it can be fully submerged in water. It's unclear whether the company has a contract to sell these to the military yet. Finally, Milton announced the Water Adventure Vehicle (WAV), a jet ski with no emissions and little noise pollution. ""Just as we're disrupting how we move on the land, we're disrupting how we move on the water,"" Jordan Darling, Nikola's VP of powersports, told the audience last night. ""You'll now be able to explore the most pristine waterways without impacting the environment,"" Darling added. Like the NZT, the WAV is set for commercialization in 2021. Few specs were given for the new jet ski, other than Milton mentioning that it has a 12-inch 4K display that is apparently fully submersible. Reservations for the WAV opened up last night. It takes a village Automotive engineering and electronics firm Bosch worked very closely with Nikola in developing the company's trucks and off-road vehicles. The truck features a vehicle control unit (VCU) running a ""secure operating system that provides real-time, over-the-air updates and monitoring,"" according to a press release from Bosch. In a conversation with Bosch prior to last night's launch, Commercial Vehicle Vice President Jason Roycht said that Bosch's relationship with Nikola was special, and the company had a team of engineers in Phoenix helping Nikola build the ""not so interesting,"" but necessary, parts of the truck. These include optimizing Nikola's trucks for fuel efficiency (unsurprisingly, Nikola's first trucks will be sold with fuel contracts, so the company essentially shoulders the burden of paying for fuel), as well as modeling truck designs to manage braking and other thermal issues that come with driving a very heavy vehicle. The company has also supplied Nikola with its Servotwin electrohydraulic steering, which is relatively novel for the trucking industry and will support automated driving in the future. Despite skepticism around hydrogen as a fuel in general, Roycht said Bosch thinks fuel cells have potential in freight, where routes are more or less preplanned and where it will be easy to set up corresponding refueling centers. Nikola has also partnered with Ryder to provide leasing and service to its customers. ""With billions of miles under their belt, they already service trucks,"" Milton said last night. ""We don't want to service our own trucks; it's too expensive, too difficult."" Finance and legal A recurring theme at last night's announcement was that regulation is a burden unsuited to innovation. Milton pulled Arizona Governor Doug Ducey (R) on stage to praise Nikola's new home state, Arizona, as a low-regulation environment. Nikola recently acquired large tracts of land in Arizona to build its manufacturing center and recently announced hydrogen lab. The company has promised to employ thousands of people in exchange for local tax breaks. In response to a question about what government could or should do to foster zero-emissions innovation, Milton said he hoped regulators would ""get out of the way,"" claiming it could take three to four years to permit a hydrogen refueling station, when it needs to take much less time. But Nikola isn't totally averse to the long arm of government. In May of last year, Nikola sued Tesla for $2 billion, claiming that its Nikola One truck cab, which debuted before the Tesla Semi, looked ""substantially similar"" to Tesla's all battery electric cab. In December, the case was transferred from Arizona District Court to the Northern California District Court (PDF), where a judge is permitting a one-year discovery phase. Currently, though, Nikola seems adequately situated, especially on the financing side of the company. Milton said last night that his company is about to open a $1.5 billion financing round, without any debt yet. Responding to a question about whether he plans to take the company public, Milton said no and pointed to Tesla. ""I feel really bad for what Tesla's going through,"" Milton said, explaining that he thought the company was getting unfairly penalized for missing targets.

Reuters sources claim that Apple has talked with ""at least"" four possible suppliers as it looks for a ""revolutionary"" lidar sensor design. Where existing autonomous vehicles tend to have bulky, expensive sensor packs that use mechanical parts to scan the road, Apple wants lidar that could fit into the aesthetics of a car while scanning ""hundreds of meters"" ahead and costing hundreds of dollars, not tens of thousands. The company might not be twiddling its thumbs waiting for a response, though, as it's reportedly developing its own lidar system. It's not clear how far along that project might be. Apple isn't commenting on the rumor, but there is evidence to show that it's ramping up its self-driving efforts rather than scaling back.

""I think it will become very quickly — maybe even towards the end of this year, but I would say I'd be shocked if it's not next year, at the latest — that having a human intervene will decrease safety,"" Musk said. Musk later said that Tesla's autonomous-driving technology was improving at an exponential rate, and that it seemed to him that the company is ahead of its competitors in the autonomous-driving industry. ""I could be wrong, but it appears to be the case that Tesla is vastly ahead of everyone,"" Musk said. Read more: Inside Tesla Twitter, where legendary short-sellers and amateur investors gather to trash and praise Elon Musk's electric empire The interview with Fridman was just the latest in a history of bold predictions Musk has made about autonomous-driving technology. During a February interview with ARK Invest, Musk said he was ""certain"" that Tesla vehicles will be able to operate without any driver intervention by the end of this year, pending regulatory approval. But Musk has missed projections about autonomous-driving technology on multiple occasions. In 2015, Musk said Tesla would have fully autonomous driving technology ready in about two years, and Tesla has passed multiple deadlines set by Musk to send a self-driving vehicle across the US. Tesla's Autopilot system was a pioneer in semi-autonomous, driver-assistance technology. The system can control steering, acceleration, and braking in some environments with driver supervision. In 2018, Consumer Reports gave Autopilot the highest rating for capability, performance, and ease-of-use among three other driver-assistance systems, but gave it the lowest rating for keeping drivers engaged, an issue that has factored into fatal accidents involving the system. Some experts are skeptical of Tesla's ability to convert semi-autonomous technology into a fully-autonomous system. A 2019 report from the research and consulting firm Navigant Research ranked Tesla 19th out of 20 companies developing self-driving technology in strategy and execution. Have you worked for Tesla?

Few industry insiders believe such a time frame from turning the first sod to delivering the first car is realistic, but there are few entrepreneurs like Elon Musk. ""China does not have a man like Musk,"" said Jia Xinguang, a veteran Beijing-based auto-analyst. ""It's quite surprising how quickly his company is developing here,"" he said. Elon Musk is not saying exactly how much he is raising to build the Shanghai ""Gigafactory"" but some analysts have put the total investment at $2.7 billion — much of which is coming from Chinese state banks. Having only announced the deal in the middle of last year, he jetted in on a bleak rainy day in January to tour the sodden fields with Shanghai's mayor, planting Tesla's flag and declaring his factory will add to the city's beauty.  ""This will arguably be one of the most advanced factories in the world of any kind, perhaps the most advanced,"" he said at the ground-breaking ceremony. ""It's very impressive to see the capabilities of Shanghai in building things, so we believe with the resources here, we can build the Shanghai Gigafactory in record time,"" Mr Musk said. He said the Shanghai factory will only produce Tesla's 3 and Y models — the smallest and most affordable sedans, which the company is staking its future on.  The more Tesla makes, the less each one costs, and the more Musk sells. ""Some believe the production cost of a Model 3 in China is only half what it is in the US. So if the base model currently costs upwards of $35,000 in the US, maybe Tesla could get it as low as $20,000 in China in future,"" Jia Xinguang said. ""This would definitely have a huge impact on China's new energy vehicle market,"" he said. Mr Musk's China gamble is a no-brainer. More than half the world's electric and hybrid vehicles are sold in China, and yearly sales are growing at a rapid rate despite a slowdown for petrol cars. Electric vehicles (EVs) now make up close to 5 per cent of China's massive automobile market, and the Government wants them to account for one in every five new cars sold by 2025.  Some of the more bullish analysts believe China is on track to more than double that target, although a planned phase-out of government subsidies will likely curtail growth. ""Chinese buyers are quite sensitive to price, so reducing subsidies will almost certainly have an effect,"" said Cui Dongshu, the Secretary-General of China's Passenger Car Association. China's electric ambitions were on full display this week with close to two dozen Chinese carmakers displaying electric sedans, SUVs and concept cars at the Shanghai Auto Show.  The Government is now finding other ways to push what it calls ""New Energy Vehicles"" (NEVs), including an innovative ""cap-and-trade"" scheme that punishes Chinese car manufacturers that don't make EVs. While China lags some Scandinavian countries for the proportion of EVs on the roads, the policies and scale of the market have made it the centre of a cut-throat race among manufacturers to dominate the future of the global industry. ""I don't think it's risky for Elon Musk to make such a large investment in China,"" Mr Cui said. ""In Shanghai, the technology is advanced, the labour cost isn't very high and I think Tesla will co-exist harmoniously with domestic competitors."" It helps that Tesla and Elon Musk are revered in China. During one visit last year, a middle-aged egg-pancake seller became famous after Mr Musk bought one of her snacks and devoured it on the side of the road.  On a later visit, his traditional hot-pot dinner in Beijing was captured by a fan and again circulated around the Chinese internet. Tesla enthusiasts regularly drive to the construction site outside Shanghai and fly drones over it, posting videos online documenting the pace of progress.  China's Premier Li Keqiang even reportedly offered Musk permanent residency when they met in January. China is not just a land of opportunity for Mr Musk. It is also the place where Tesla is most likely to meet its match. China boasts more than a dozen companies making hybrid or fully electric vehicles — from state-owned behemoths to huge private companies and smaller start-ups.  And it's the privately-owned BYD that arguably poses the largest competitive threat. The Shenzhen-based company came close to matching Tesla's 245,000 deliveries last year, with the vast bulk of cars sold in China. Another automaker, BAIC — owned by the Beijing government — produced the highest-selling model in the country: the compact EC-Series that sells for $35,000 before subsidies.  ""The main reason I bought one is because a government subsidy halved the price and it's easier to get number plates for electric cars,"" said Beijing resident Kelvin Fung, who bought a BAIC in February. He said a policy that allows electric car owners to drive seven days a week instead of being subjected to a six-day congestion restriction for petrol cars was another incentive. ""I personally think though that Chinese cars are not as good as overseas brands, but they're quite cheap,"" he said. Reports of quality problems and dubious range claims have further reinforced views that despite the enthusiasm of both the Government and domestic car markers, China is still yet to produce a genuine rival to Tesla. ""Elon Musk can design special products that capture people's hearts, by contrast the electric cars designed in China are boring,"" said Jia Xinguang. ""Chinese electric cars are not as fun"", he said.

Spoiler: it's very spicy according to Kia. But they're not exactly wrong. After showing a drift version of the exciting Stinger the automaker took the wraps off an EV concept where all the doors open up like a supercar. The HabaNiro, based on the Niro (get it? Haba Niro. Yeah.), is what Kia calls an ""everything car"" that's both electric and built for level five autonomy. that sort of self-driving car is years (if not decades) away, but concept cars about the future and Kia is going all in with the HabaNiro while using its tried and true Niro platform. The all-wheel-drive EV will have a range of over 300 miles. It has seating for five and because of its butterfly doors, it should be easier to get in and out of the bright red interior. Because future, there are no actual knobs or buttons inside. Instead, the dash acts as a touch screen while the windshield has a heads up display, or in autonomous mode, the whole thing will become a video screen so you can watch videos. The SUV uses biometric scanning to start the car and setup your personal profile. It'll also monitor your vitals to adjust the driving experience. Hopefully, that doesn't mean it'll offer you all the power when you're angry.  So if you're into puns, butterfly doors that go up and EVs, Kia's got your back. But not really, it's a concept car, you'll never see this in your driveway which is kinda sad. Also, if we've learned anything from Tesla, wacky doors on a car regular people buy are not a good idea.

Instead it’s proposing that Britain’s big four accountants - PwC, EY, KPMG and Deloitte - ring fence their audit arms from their more lucrative consulting businesses. The fingerprints of Andrew Tyrie, the CMA’s chair, are all over what the watchdog prefers to call “operational separation”. In his role as chair of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, he successfully prodded the government into requiring that banks ring fence their retail arms (savings, lending to the likes of you and me) from their City businesses (advising on floats and deals, underwriting them and rolling the dice in the financial casino). One issue with adopting the same approach for accountants is that it isn't so much what’s good for the goose is good for the gander as it is what’s good for the goose is good for the yellow tailed warbler. It applies the same solution to different problems coughed up by very different businesses, although they do have in common their involvement in a succession of tawdry scandals which they’ve shown scant sign of accepting any responsibility for together with a notable failure to manage conflicts of interest. But perhaps the criticism isn’t entirely fair. The CMA has conducted an exhaustive investigation and it isn’t just ring fencing that auditors will have to put up with if and when the government has legislated to enforce the conclusions. Big companies will have to engage smaller firms of accountants alongside the big four to jointly audit their books, and their audit committees will face tougher regulation. One set of critics (and I count myself among them) wonder whether the proposals go far enough but another other maintains that they will simply result in higher costs for businesses when there’s no evidence that they will result in better book keeping. Thing is, they haven’t come up with any better ideas. They also typically argue that the sort of break up recommended by MPs on the Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy Committee would be too hard, international companies need access to international standard auditors and the consultants they pal around with etc, etc, etc. Far better to do nothing very much and let them get on with it. The fact is that people have been talking about improving big auditors’ book keeping ever since KPMG signed off HBOS as a going concern in 2007 just six months before it went pop and had to be bailed out by Lloyds in a government sponsored rescue. Since then there have been a succession of reports and nothing much has changed and oh look, there’s Carillion, BHS, Interserve. None of these collapses were down to the auditors. The problem has been with their persistent unwillingness to say “Houston, we have a problem”, leading one to question quite what the point of an audit is. It is indeed an open question as to whether the CMA’s proposals will do any good. It’s worth noting that the US and the EU have been grappling with the issues, and they haven’t as yet come up with any answers to the dilemmas posed by the big four and the virtual monopoly they hold when it comes to auditing big company accounts. Their responses to the CMA ranged from sharply critical in the case of EY to quite positive in the case of KPMG, possibly a reflection of the fact that it has been taking the most flak.",cma stops short forcing break britain book keepers proposals make audits better,predicted couple weeks ago competition markets authority stopped short recommending break britain book keepers instead proposing britain big four accountants pwc ey kpmg deloitte ring fence audit arms lucrative consulting businesses fingerprints andrew tyrie cma chair watchdog prefers call operational separation role chair parliamentary commission banking standards successfully prodded government requiring banks ring fence retail arms savings lending likes city businesses advising floats deals underwriting rolling dice financial casino one issue adopting approach accountants much good goose good gander good goose good yellow tailed warbler applies solution different problems coughed different businesses although common involvement succession tawdry scandals shown scant sign accepting responsibility together notable failure manage conflicts interest perhaps criticism entirely fair cma conducted exhaustive investigation ring fencing auditors put government legislated enforce conclusions big companies engage smaller firms accountants alongside big four jointly audit books audit committees face tougher regulation one set critics count among wonder whether proposals go far enough another maintains simply result higher costs businesses evidence result better book keeping thing come better ideas also typically argue sort break recommended mps business energy industrial strategy committee would hard international companies need access international standard auditors consultants pal around etc etc etc far better nothing much let get fact people talking improving big auditors book keeping ever since kpmg signed hbos going concern six months went pop bailed lloyds government sponsored rescue since succession reports nothing much changed oh look carillion bhs interserve none collapses auditors problem persistent unwillingness say houston problem leading one question quite point audit indeed open question whether cma proposals good worth noting us eu grappling issues yet come answers dilemmas posed big four virtual monopoly hold comes auditing big company accounts responses cma ranged sharply critical case ey quite positive case kpmg possibly reflection fact taking flak

Elon Musk first tweeted the picture as a joke, but then went a step further by replacing his Twitter avatar with the image of the farmyard animal. This did not sit right with the sheep photo's owners, the Museum of English Rural Life, which soon made a change of its own. Now visitors to its Twitter page will be greeted with Musk's smiling face. Musk is known for participating in running jokes and slang online, such as previously asking Twitter users for their ""dankest memes"" and releasing a rap song about Harambe, the gorilla shot dead in a US zoo who then became a social media touchstone. And he has been enjoying his time as a sheep by replying to genuine Tesla car customers with oblique sheep puns to thank them for their purchases. Likewise, the Museum of English Rural Life regularly joins in with internet humour, and has used its time as Musk to tweet jokes about ""electric sheep called Teslewe"". Adam Koszary, Programme Manager and Digital Lead for Museums Partnership Reading, is the man behind the museum on Twitter. ""The end-game for our whole Twitter,"" he told the BBC, ""is engaging people with English rural life, even if that means memes. ""We'll change our picture back either when Elon changes his back, or at the point where people are confused enough to show up to Elon Musk's house expecting it to be the Museum of English Rural Life."" The original sheep picture originates from the museum's archives, where it is described as a 1962 photo of an Exmoor Horn aged ram, taken in Devon. It caught the attention of the internet in April 2018 when the museum, which is part of the University of Reading, shared the picture online alongside the caption ""look at this absolute unit"". The phrase ""absolute unit"" is internet jargon, meaning a large, muscular person or thing. It is regularly used as a compliment - for example, it has been used thousands of times online to describe both a shockingly muscular kangaroo and a giant steer who each made the news in 2018. With regards to the ram, Dr Ollie Douglas, Curator of the Museum of English Rural Life Collections, revealed the secret behind its size. ""The breed was intended for meat and wool production,"" he wrote in a blog post. ""In other words, it was the full package, or as our social media folks put it, 'an absolute unit'."" The museum has built itself a bit of a reputation for funny business online. In January 2019 it started a war with fellow museums over who has the best duck in its archives, and in October 2018 it may have spawned a new JK Rowling character with a tweet about a chicken in trousers. And in February 2019, meanwhile, the tweets in its thread of updates about a lost bat in its rare book store were liked more than 25,000 times. The bat became so popular online that it was even awarded its own university library card.",elon musk swaps shots museum english rural life,heard one sheep big ceo tesla made profile picture elon musk first tweeted picture joke went step replacing twitter avatar image farmyard animal sit right sheep photo owners museum english rural life soon made change visitors twitter page greeted musk smiling face musk known participating running jokes slang online previously asking twitter users dankest memes releasing rap song harambe gorilla shot dead us zoo became social media touchstone enjoying time sheep replying genuine tesla car customers oblique sheep puns thank purchases likewise museum english rural life regularly joins internet humour used time musk tweet jokes electric sheep called teslewe adam koszary programme manager digital lead museums partnership reading man behind museum twitter whole twitter told bbc engaging people english rural life even means memes change picture back either elon changes back point people confused enough show elon musk house expecting museum english rural life original sheep picture originates museum archives described photo exmoor horn aged ram taken devon caught attention internet april museum part university reading shared picture online alongside caption look absolute unit phrase absolute unit internet jargon meaning large muscular person thing regularly used compliment example used thousands times online describe shockingly muscular kangaroo giant steer made news regards ram dr ollie douglas curator museum english rural life collections revealed secret behind size breed intended meat wool production wrote blog post words full package social media folks put absolute unit museum built bit reputation funny business online january started war fellow museums best duck archives october may spawned new jk rowling character tweet chicken trousers february meanwhile tweets thread updates lost bat rare book store liked times bat became popular online even awarded university library card

And investing gurus are sounding the alarm for investors about the looming impact on publicly owned US utilities, which looks to bear the brunt of changes in the earth's climate. Just look at Pacific Gas and Electric Company. BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset managers, says that US utility companies with aging infrastructures are especially underprepared for ""climate shocks"" and that investors should take note. ""Extreme weather risks already threaten utility stocks — and are set to rise in frequency and intensity over time — but are not fully priced in,"" BlackRock said in a report this month. BlackRock says gas and coal-fired power plants, which make up almost two-thirds of America's generation capacity, are most exposed to risks including wildfires, rising temperatures, flooding, and drought. ""Electric utilities with exposure to extreme weather events typically suffer temporary price and volatility shocks in the wake of natural disasters,"" BlackRock said. BlackRock Raj Thamotheram, who formerly led environmental, social, and governance investing at the pension fund USS, said investors in utilities and other energy producers could face ""significant portfolio damage"" as a result of the sector's ""willful blindness"" and failure to take action on climate risk. Thamotheram also founded a think tank called Preventable Surprises. Utilities are generally seen as a safe bet for steady, long-term returns given their necessity and creditworthiness. They're a favorite of long-term investors including mutual and pension funds. But this may change going forward. Twenty investors with about $1.8 trillion under management wrote to US utilities last month to urge them to decarbonize and upgrade systems, saying the world was on a path to ""climate disaster."" Meanwhile on Tuesday, New York State Common Retirement Fund, the third-largest pension fund in the US, looked to decarbonize its holdings, saying climate change was among other notable dangers to the sector. ""Risks include liability for carbon-emission effects, value depression and demand shifts resulting from innovation and consumer choice,"" the fund said in a recent report. US investors and insurers are seen to be behind their European counterparts on the issue. BlackRock says utility companies will need to invest in upgrading and improving their systems to cope with new conditions. Damages incurred could cause capital losses for investors, though some of this risk can be mitigated through hedging. ""It goes beyond green investments, divestment, or portfolio decolonization — which does nothing to manage systemic risk — it's about assertively challenging boards and senior management to align business plans with the Paris agreement,"" Thamotheram said in an interview. Companies have been making efforts to protect themselves. For example, the Akron, Ohio-based FirstEnergy has introduced greater geographic distribution, meaning other areas of its business can cover for losses in the event of hurricane damage. There are still risks, however, as a recent bout of severe weather showed, causing thousands of customers to go without power. The company's share price took a hit of more than 2% on Tuesday. Similarly, as the US's Fourth National Climate Assessment says, ""major water utilities provide examples of planning that focus on identifying and managing vulnerabilities to a wide range of uncertain future conditions, rather than evaluating performance for a single future."" A good case study for the impact climate change can have on investors comes from California. It's thought that the state's temperature has risen by 3 degrees Fahrenheit on average over the past century, with droughts and water shortages increasingly common. The fires that scorched thousands of acres of California land and killed scores of people over the past few years have now all but destroyed the San Francisco-based utility Pacific Gas and Electric Company, which buckled under about $52 billion in debt. PG&E saw about 75% of its market capitalization wiped out at the end of last year, its CEO step down, and its bonds rated junk, and its liabilities may balloon to over $30 billion. Wildfires and drought-like conditions have exacerbated the state's problems, with some utilities forced to stop electricity generation from hydropower because of forced water reallocations and insufficient water flows — highlighting the scale of the issue already.",traders ignoring climate change may shock blackrock says america aging utilities risk,climate change investing gurus sounding alarm investors looming impact publicly owned us utilities looks bear brunt changes earth climate look pacific gas electric company blackrock one world largest asset managers says us utility companies aging infrastructures especially underprepared climate shocks investors take note extreme weather risks already threaten utility stocks set rise frequency intensity time fully priced blackrock said report month blackrock says gas power plants make almost america generation capacity exposed risks including wildfires rising temperatures flooding drought electric utilities exposure extreme weather events typically suffer temporary price volatility shocks wake natural disasters blackrock said blackrock raj thamotheram formerly led environmental social governance investing pension fund uss said investors utilities energy producers could face significant portfolio damage result sector willful blindness failure take action climate risk thamotheram also founded think tank called preventable surprises utilities generally seen safe bet steady returns given necessity creditworthiness favorite investors including mutual pension funds may change going forward twenty investors trillion management wrote us utilities last month urge decarbonize upgrade systems saying world path climate disaster meanwhile tuesday new york state common retirement fund pension fund us looked decarbonize holdings saying climate change among notable dangers sector risks include liability effects value depression demand shifts resulting innovation consumer choice fund said recent report us investors insurers seen behind european counterparts issue blackrock says utility companies need invest upgrading improving systems cope new conditions damages incurred could cause capital losses investors though risk mitigated hedging goes beyond green investments divestment portfolio decolonization nothing manage systemic risk assertively challenging boards senior management align business plans paris agreement thamotheram said interview companies making efforts protect example akron firstenergy introduced greater geographic distribution meaning areas business cover losses event hurricane damage still risks however recent bout severe weather showed causing thousands customers go without power company share price took hit tuesday similarly us fourth national climate assessment says major water utilities provide examples planning focus identifying managing vulnerabilities wide range uncertain future conditions rather evaluating performance single future good case study impact climate change investors comes california thought state temperature risen degrees fahrenheit average past century droughts water shortages increasingly common fires scorched thousands acres california land killed scores people past years destroyed san utility pacific gas electric company buckled billion debt pg e saw market capitalization wiped end last year ceo step bonds rated junk liabilities may balloon billion wildfires conditions exacerbated state problems utilities forced stop electricity generation hydropower forced water reallocations insufficient water flows highlighting scale issue already

With its twin electric motors drawing power from a lithium-ion battery pack, the K50 can punch out 430 horsepower and 560 pound-feet of torque, enough to launch it from 0 to 60 in just 4.3 seconds, with an electronically limited top speed of 112 mph. Already on sale in China, there is a two-month backlog of orders, said David Michery, founder and CEO of California-based Mullen Technologies, a start-up partnering with Chinese automaker Qiantu Motor to bring the K50 to the U.S. market next year. When the first generation of electric vehicles came to market at the beginning of the decade, products like the Nissan Leaf put an emphasis on range above everything else, largely limiting the fun-to-drive factor. Tesla changed the equation with its original sedan, the Model S, which could match the acceleration of some of the fastest sports and muscle cars on the market, especially when equipped with optional Ludicrous Mode. The K50 sits low and wide, with classic supercar proportions, and the partners behind the project are betting there is an emerging and still largely untapped market for high-performance electric cars. To maximize both range and performance, the K50's development put a premium on what the industry refers to as ""lightweighting."" The body is made of super-light carbon fiber, the roughly two dozen exterior panels weighing in at just 103 pounds, noted Mullen's chief engineer, Frank McMahon. They're wrapped around an all-aluminum space-frame. Twin, liquid-cooled electric motors, one on each axle, are connected to a 70 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack. The layout allows for what McMahon called ""Dynamic Torque Vectoring."" By shifting power from front to back, the K50 can enhance its ability to negotiate sharp corners and twisty roads. Its independent double-wishbone suspension further improves maneuverability. The pack is rated for 230 miles between charges in China, though that figure is expected to come in lower using the U.S. EPA test cycle. One of the odd details of the K50 is the use of a T-shaped battery pack. That was an approach used early in the decade by manufacturers like General Motors, which had a T-shaped pack in its Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid. That approach gobbled up interior space and raised the Chevy's center of gravity, working against its handling. McMahon told CNBC that Mullen and Qiantu opted for the approach because it reduced investment costs and also allowed for more flexibility in the K50's overall design. That said, the partners are working to develop a next-generation platform which, much like the skateboard-like layout used on Tesla's Models S, X and 3, mounts batteries and motors below the load floor. Mullen and Qiantu hope to use that ""architecture"" on a new SUV McMahon says they plan to debut in 2022. For the U.S. market, Qiantu will ship a number of key components of the K50 to the U.S. where Mullen will assemble them, much like a kit car. Some parts will be sourced from the States, however, including the battery pack that is currently produced in San Francisco and then shipped to China. The Chinese version of the K50 will undergo a number of modifications for the U.S. market, many of those focused on meeting American safety regulations. McMahon said Mullen also wants to tighten gaps between carbon fiber panels to meet the expectation of picky U.S. buyers. The electric drive system on the K50 is paired with an array of advanced technologies including a 15.6-inch touch screen that controls the car's infotainment system and other vehicle functions. There are also a number of high-tech advanced driver assistance systems, including forward collision warning, lane keeping assist and blind-spot detection. Michery said the start-up expects to price the U.S. version of the K50 at around $149,000 when it reaches showrooms next year. The initial target is to sell about 1,000 of the sports cars in 2020, the figure rising to 5,000 annually, starting in 2022. Whether it will be able to build that much of a market is far from certain.

Everyone knew that the hapless Debenhams CEO was on his way out. Still, it was pretty cynical of the retailer to leave it until 3pm on the day before the extended Easter weekend to confirm the widely trailed departure. “Now that our new financing facilities are in place, it is time to move on, knowing the company is in good hands with a plan that will deliver a sustainable future,” said the former Amazoner who must wish he’d never left the internet giant. Sure, being the ultimate boss holds a powerful pull even for executives with fancy jobs at prestigious companies. But Debenhams was on a sticky wicket when he joined and the warning signs should have been obvious enough to him. Turning the business around was always going to be a tough ask, one made all the more difficult by the requirement to fend off Sports Direct kingpin Mike Ashley, who ultimately got Bucher booted off the board for his trouble. But we’re always being told people like him are rare talents with the ability to fly, run around the world at six million miles an hour, shoot lasers from their eyes and turn retailing sows ears and into silk purses while they’re at it. That’s why they need such fancy salary and bonus packages. Bucher singularly failed to live up to the hype in almost every respect bar one: keeping Ashley at bay. There are still plenty who will thank him for that but it's probably not enough to save his retailing rep, at least in this country. Debehams said that a search is now underway for his successor, to which the obvious reaction is to say, “good luck with that”. Having been through an administration process, the retailer is now owned by its lenders. In the short term it still needs restructuring. That inevitably means store closures and job losses. In the longer term, they’ll want to sell it to someone. Lenders are in the business of lending to businesses, not owning them.",debenhams sneaks confirmation ceo bucher departure earth going replace,see sergio bucher everyone knew hapless debenhams ceo way still pretty cynical retailer leave day extended easter weekend confirm widely trailed departure new financing facilities place time move knowing company good hands plan deliver sustainable future said former amazoner must wish never left internet giant sure ultimate boss holds powerful pull even executives fancy jobs prestigious companies debenhams sticky wicket joined warning signs obvious enough turning business around always going tough ask one made difficult requirement fend sports direct kingpin mike ashley ultimately got bucher booted board trouble always told people like rare talents ability fly run around world six million miles hour shoot lasers eyes turn retailing sows ears silk purses need fancy salary bonus packages bucher singularly failed live hype almost every respect bar one keeping ashley bay still plenty thank probably enough save retailing rep least country debehams said search underway successor obvious reaction say good luck administration process retailer owned lenders short term still needs restructuring inevitably means store closures job losses longer term want sell someone lenders business lending businesses owning

After briefly catching fire in February, the car caught fire once again about three hours after being towed to a repair shop in Monroeville on Wednesday, just outside of the city, according to CBS Pittsburgh, which first reported on the incident. Firefighters battled the blaze for about four hours before it went out, according to the report. ""It's burned beyond recognition,"" Doug Smeltz of Smeltz Auto Service told Business Insider, adding that the fire burnt a large hole in the shops parking lot. According to Smeltz, a Tesla employee disconnected the battery's main shut off before it was towed and said the car would not catch fire. The cause of the fire remains unknown. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Wednesday's fire is far from the first time a Tesla vehicle has made a headache for firefighters. In December, a Model S caught fire twice after suffering a flat tire in Los Gatos, California. That followed a similar fire in June in Los Angeles, in which British film director Michael Morris' vehicle suddenly ignited. In its information for first responders on its website, Tesla advises emergency service members to use the cars touch screen in order to activate ""tow mode"" and disengage the parking brake. The company also warns that it can take thousands of gallons of water to put out a battery fire. ""If the battery catches fire, is exposed to high heat, or is generating heat or gases, use large amounts of water to cool the battery,"" the emergency response sheet reads. ""It can take approximately 3,000 gallons of water (applied directly to the battery); establish sufficient water supply.""",tesla model x suv reportedly caught fire towed shop despite company employee saying would tsla,one tesla owner pittsburgh bad luck tesla model x suv briefly catching fire february car caught fire three hours towed repair shop monroeville wednesday outside city according cbs pittsburgh first reported incident firefighters battled blaze four hours went according report burned beyond recognition doug smeltz smeltz auto service told business insider adding fire burnt large hole shops parking lot according smeltz tesla employee disconnected battery main shut towed said car would catch fire cause fire remains unknown tesla immediately respond request comment business insider wednesday fire far first time tesla vehicle made headache firefighters december model caught fire twice suffering flat tire los gatos california followed similar fire june los angeles british film director michael morris vehicle suddenly ignited information first responders website tesla advises emergency service members use cars touch screen order activate tow mode disengage parking brake company also warns take thousands gallons water put battery fire battery catches fire exposed high heat generating heat gases use large amounts water cool battery emergency response sheet reads take approximately gallons water applied directly battery establish sufficient water supply

The ticket for the weekend alone costs $429 and then you have to factor in lodging, airfare, a car rental, and other fees. Depending on luck and planning, the weekend could easily top $2,500. While a lot of people might attend the event because they love the fashion, the glittering scene of social media influencers and celebrities, or as an excuse to skip school, the performances are what drew me in. Friday, the first night of the festival, had a main-stage lineup that I could only dream about: Anderson .Paak and the Free Nationals, Janelle Monae, and Childish Gambino, my three favorite artists of the moment. Seeing any one of those artists on a solo tour could easily cost you $150 a ticket, assuming you can get a ticket at all. Both Anderson .Paak and Childish Gambino's latest tours sold out shortly after going on sale. Janelle Monae is currently on the festival circuit, but you can bet a ticket for any upcoming tour of hers will be just as coveted. Getting a front row seat to any of those artists is even more difficult and expensive. When I purchased tickets to Childish Gambino's 2018 tour, I used a credit card pre-sale to get special access to good seats and I was still only able to get $180 floor seats at the far end of Wells Fargo Arena in Philadelphia. Donald Glover was little more than an ant in my vision. The beauty of Coachella, and any festival for that matter, is that anyone can get a front-row seat to their favorite artist, so long as you are willing to wait. As Anderson .Paak and the Free Nationals, Janelle Monae, and Childish Gambino were all, more or less, playing back-to-back on Friday — with a one-set interlude by Britpop band The 1975 — I headed to the main stage during Kacey Musgraves' performance. As the country star's fans filed out at the end of her set, I was able to secure a spot along the fence-line adjacent to the stage. It was the perfect position to watch the acts. Making it through six hours of performances without leaving the spot was a feat of endurance — I did make one exit during The 1975 to hit the bathroom and grab food, but my partner held the spot. It paid off. Here's how close I was to Childish Gambino during his electric headlining set: This photo of Childish Gambino was taken without a zoom lens. He was a few feet in front of me for much of the show.

Tesla's cars are too expensive to qualify. (TSLA),"Tesla vehicles will be ineligible for the Canadian government's new $5,000 electric vehicle tax credit when it takes effect on May 1. In guidelines published Wednesday by Transport Canada, base-model vehicles with six or fewer seats must have sticker price below $45,000 CAD with allowances up to $55,000 CAD MSRP for higher-priced trims. Tesla's cheapest car, the Model 3, starts at $53,700 in Canada, according to the company's website. The Model S and X start at $114,000 CAD and $117,000 CAD, respectively. Other vehicles that meet the threshold for the tax credit include the Chevrolet Bolt and Volt, Chrysler's Pacifica Hybrid, Audi A3 e-tron, Ford Fusion Energi, and others. You can find the full list here. ""Canada is committed to decarbonizing the country's transportation sector and becoming a global leader in zero-emissions vehicle,"" Transport Canada said on its website. ""Analysis has shown that without any further action, Canada could achieve zero-emissions vehicle sales of 4% to 6% of all new light-duty vehicles purchased by 2025 and 5% to 10% by 2030."" By 2040, the government says, all vehicles on Canadian roads can be zero-emission. In 2018, Tesla surpassed the limit of vehicles sold for the US' governments similar tax credit. Once the automaker passed 200,000 cars sold, the incentive was halved to $3,750 in January.

Those at the show are also only a fraction of the 72 Chinese firms that supply the bulk of the 22 million cars sold in China last year. Although that is down a little on the recent past, the Chinese consumer still buys more cars in one month than the British do in a year. There are 327 million cars on Chinese roads. Approximately. Only  a decade ago the Shanghai show was populated by comical knock-off copies of successful models made by anyone from Rolls-Royce to Kia, with a few recycled western models such as the 1980s VW Passat enjoying an afterlife as basic cheap transport for the growing market. No longer. The likes of Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) are gradually moving out of the shadow of the joint ventures. SAIC still makes cars with VW and General Motors, but it is also developing stronger products of its own. Having acquired the names and rights of various bits of the old MG Rover for example, it is rapidly reviving the MG, LDV Maxus and Rover, renamed Roewe, badges. Maxus is a marque in its own right now, with an all new panel van unveiled at the show, the V90, that seems a match for, say, the Transit or VW Transporter. it has also expanded into SUVs and unveiled a stylish new MPV, the G50; all this from a moribund British van maker. SAIC, like so many Chinese brands at the show, is also set to leapfrog western rivals by putting huge resources into electric vehicle technology and the 5G revolution, which will bring autonomous vehicles on public roads into the realm of reality. After all, China dominates the battery market already, and Huawei is a leader in telecoms and next-generation telemetrics. It is also pushing hard at the hydrogen fuel cell model, another alternative to traditional fossil fuels. The Germans and Japanese may be better mechanical engineers and be the masters of the internal combustion, but all the physical, financial and human capital they have ploughed into world leadership might easily be worthless by 2030. Chinese startups such as Grove and Nio are trying to challenge Tesla as well. Those (for now) obscure badges you see on garish stands in Shanghai may soon be on a steering wheel in front of your very eyes. Which is not to say that the old world is yet dead. Electric or not, the craze for SUVs continues to be the overwhelming global trend in passenger car design, with the emphasis on bulky coupe styling. Among many others, Buick and VW unveiled three apiece, Porsche is to offer us a coupe version of its massive Cayenne, the Land Wind folk knocked out another generic status symbol, as did Mercedes-Benz with the GLB, and Lynk & Co with a Volvo-based product. Plus Roewe, as mentioned, presented a kind of born-again Chinese Rover and showed off its Marvel X electric SUV. It boasts the biggest iPad-style screen ever seen in a production vehicle, about two feet deep, a huge VW-style grille, and some nice tan leather and wood trim. I’d like one, but then I always liked Rovers.

Both sides say in a letter filed Thursday with a federal court in New York that they talked for over an hour this week and are continuing to discuss an agreement. District Judge Alison Nathan granted the request to talk until April 25. Lawyers for the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the court to find Musk in contempt for violating a settlement order that requires Musk’s tweets to be approved by a lawyer if they disclose important company facts. Nathan had ordered both sides to meet and work out differences by Thursday. The settlement was reached last year after Musk tweeted he had secured funding to take Tesla private even though he had not. The SEC says Musk violated that agreement when he tweeted about vehicle production without approval in February. Nathan had ordered both sides to meet for at least an hour to work out their differences and if they couldn’t, she would rule on whether to hold Musk in contempt. The settlement was reached last October after Musk tweeted that he had secured funding to take Tesla private when in fact he had not. The tweet sent Tesla’s stock on a wild ride and the SEC says it harmed investors who bought shares after the tweet but before they had accurate information. The SEC says Musk violated the agreement when he tweeted about vehicle production in February without approval. The 13-word tweet said Tesla would produce around 500,000 vehicles this year. But it wasn’t approved by Tesla’s “disclosure counsel,” and the SEC said Musk had not sought a lawyer’s approval for a single tweet. Musk argued the tweet didn’t need approval because it wasn’t new information that was meaningful to investors. His attorneys said the SEC was violating his First Amendment right to free speech.

A lot. Not only for personal reasons, but also for professional reasons — I'm a writer that often covers destinations, hotels, wine regions — you get the gist. I'm basically gone at least one week each month, which I love, but it can be hard on my bags, clothes, and general lifestyle. So when I was just starting out in my career, I knew I needed a bag that wouldn't a) cost more than my paycheck, b) kill my back/shoulder/insert-aging-body-part-here, and c) preferably do double-duty as a gym or work bag when needed. Enter the Lo & Sons O.G. Overnight Bag ($295). I found this bag only a couple of years after the company launched in 2010. The O.G. is a shoulder bag that can house pretty much everything — and I do mean everything— you need when traveling. I regularly it as my ""personal item"" when traveling, stowing it under my seat, but I've also used it for quick overnights and gym-to-office-to-happy-hour long days. With multiple pockets, a keychain attachment (so you'll never lose your keys), hidden shoe compartment at the bottom, laptop compartment, two leather shoulder straps, a detachable longer strap, and more, it's been with me through thick and thin, and has held up through it all. I have the Army Green colorway with gold hardware, which gives it a little more personality (I think) than basic black, but still keeps things looking professional. Lo & Sons makes the bag in a ton of colors, so you'll definitely find something you'll love, and it also has another size called the O.M.G. that's slightly smaller and $20 less expensive than the O.G. Read more: Lo & Sons makes bags that are expertly designed for travel — I was able to fit a weekend's worth of items in its largest backpack The hidden shoe compartment at the bottom is also helpful in keeping your things away from filthy soles.
Lo & Sons The round shape at the top is perfect for squishing my airplane pillow in when I don't want it attached to my bag, and the interior is easy to wipe down for spills and disinfecting. I love the zippered compartment in the back that lets you quickly attach the bag to your carry-on handle, so you can zoom around the airport without it falling off the top of your bag or shoulder. The leather handle straps are only now showing some signs of wear, though looking at the base, they're still structurally sound. And the detachable shoulder strap? Well, that was the one thing that eventually went caput. One of the clasps began to stay open, causing the bag to detach from the strap and fall. After a quick email with its customer service to inquire about buying a replacement strap, they actually sent me a brand new strap — free of charge. I was so ecstatic about this truly kind customer service that I gave it a shout out on my social media and told everyone for the next couple of days about my new and improved bag. How often does an email with customer service solve anything? In the six years since I bought my bag, it seems the strap design has changed but now, I don't have any problems — or reasons — to think this one will go caput anytime soon.",favorite travel bag lasted years nearly miles,travel lot personal reasons also professional reasons writer often covers destinations hotels wine regions get gist basically gone least one week month love hard bags clothes general lifestyle starting career knew needed bag would cost paycheck b kill c preferably gym work bag needed enter lo sons overnight bag found bag couple years company launched shoulder bag house pretty much everything mean need traveling regularly personal item traveling stowing seat also used quick overnights long days multiple pockets keychain attachment never lose keys hidden shoe compartment bottom laptop compartment two leather shoulder straps detachable longer strap thick thin held army green colorway gold hardware gives little personality think basic black still keeps things looking professional lo sons makes bag ton colors definitely find something love also another size called slightly smaller less expensive read lo sons makes bags expertly designed travel able fit weekend worth items largest backpack hidden shoe compartment bottom also helpful keeping things away filthy soles lo sons round shape top perfect squishing airplane pillow want attached bag interior easy wipe spills disinfecting love zippered compartment back lets quickly attach bag handle zoom around airport without falling top bag shoulder leather handle straps showing signs wear though looking base still structurally sound detachable shoulder strap well one thing eventually went caput one clasps began stay open causing bag detach strap fall quick email customer service inquire buying replacement strap actually sent brand new strap free charge ecstatic truly kind customer service gave shout social media told everyone next couple days new improved bag often email customer service solve anything six years since bought bag seems strap design changed problems reasons think one go caput anytime soon

The company says it could build a pair of high-speed underground tunnels between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., in less than two years. The company's plan for a proposed 35-mile underground loop is outlined in a draft environmental assessment published by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Maryland Department of Transportation. It is not the first time the Boring Company has proposed a high-profile tunnel with an aggressive timeline. Last summer Musk, the company's CEO, signed a deal with the city of Chicago to a build a high-speed, underground transportation loop between downtown Chicago and O'Hare Airport, a distance of roughly 18 miles. In announcing the Chicago deal last June, Musk said digging for the project could start in three to four months and be completed in 18 to 24 months, provided it moved through the regulatory approval process quickly. That hasn't happened. Almost a year later, the company's Chicago project has not received final approval. ""I would consider it dead,"" said Gilbert Villegas, alderman for Chicago's 34th Ward. Villegas has spent time talking with Boring Company leaders and even went for a demonstration ride in the company's test tunnel in Hawthorne, California. He said the company has a ton of smart, young engineers, but their predictions for digging and completing tunnels are too ambitious. ""On paper, a lot of these projects sound good, but [Boring Company leaders] are not being realistic with their time frames,"" Villegas said. The Baltimore-to-D.C. environmental assessment says the pair of tunnels will allow modified Tesla vehicles to zip along at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour. The underground route would be between 30 and 44 feet below the surface and for the most part mirror the path of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, one of the main routes between the two cities. According to the assessment, ""The system would operate up to 20 hours per day, with AEVs (autonomous electric vehicles) leaving each Loop Station at predetermined times. Departure intervals would be determined by various factors including station size and passenger loading time."" Initially, it would be limited to 1,000 riders per day, though that could increase over time as intermediate loop stations are added. So how long would it take to dig and finish the pair of underground tunnels, two loop stations and up to 70 ventilation shafts spread out along the route? According to the report, it could be done in 23 months. Late last year, when Musk unveiled the 1.5-mile-long test tunnel in California, he proclaimed it would be the key to finally easing ""soul crushing traffic."" At an event that included giving reporters and supporters test rides, Musk described riding in the tunnel as ""epic."" He added, ""For me it was an epiphany, like 'this thing damn well worked.'"" The public now has until early June to comment on the proposed Baltimore-to-D.C. project. After that, federal agencies, including the Federal Highway Administration, affected by the high-speed tunnel proposal would still need to approve it before the Boring Company could go forward. Two big questions remain: How much will the Baltimore-to-D.C. loop cost, and who will pick up the bill? Neither of those issues is addressed in the environmental assessment.",musk boring company pushes aggressive tunnel plan despite skeptics,elon musk boring company making bold prediction ambitious project company says could build pair underground tunnels baltimore washington less two years company plan proposed underground loop outlined draft environmental assessment published department transportation maryland department transportation first time boring company proposed tunnel aggressive timeline last summer musk company ceo signed deal city chicago build underground transportation loop downtown chicago airport distance roughly miles announcing chicago deal last june musk said digging project could start three four months completed months provided moved regulatory approval process quickly happened almost year later company chicago project received final approval would consider dead said gilbert villegas alderman chicago ward villegas spent time talking boring company leaders even went demonstration ride company test tunnel hawthorne california said company ton smart young engineers predictions digging completing tunnels ambitious paper lot projects sound good boring company leaders realistic time frames villegas said environmental assessment says pair tunnels allow modified tesla vehicles zip along speeds miles per hour underground route would feet surface part mirror path parkway one main routes two cities according assessment system would operate hours per day aevs autonomous electric vehicles leaving loop station predetermined times departure intervals would determined various factors including station size passenger loading time initially would limited riders per day though could increase time intermediate loop stations added long would take dig finish pair underground tunnels two loop stations ventilation shafts spread along route according report could done months late last year musk unveiled test tunnel california proclaimed would key finally easing soul crushing traffic event included giving reporters supporters test rides musk described riding tunnel epic added epiphany like thing damn well worked public early june comment proposed project federal agencies including federal highway administration affected tunnel proposal would still need approve boring company could go forward two big questions remain much loop cost pick bill neither issues addressed environmental assessment

A federal judge on Thursday granted a request by the two sides for more time to resolve a fight over whether Mr. Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, had violated an earlier settlement with the commission governing his public statements about the company’s finances. The S.E.C. had asked the court to hold Mr. Musk in contempt for a Twitter post on Feb. 19 in which he said Tesla would produce about 500,000 cars this year. That was at variance with the company’s guidance a month earlier that the figure would be 360,000 to 400,000. The commission asserted that the Twitter statement — which Mr. Musk later revised to conform to the earlier guidance — violated a requirement for him to get approval from a Tesla lawyer for statements that include potentially market-sensitive information. Mr. Musk’s feud with the S.E.C. stems from a Twitter post in August in which he claimed to have “funding secured” to take the company private at $420 a share. It was later revealed that he was referring to a much more embryonic proposal than he had implied. The S.E.C. sued Mr. Musk and Tesla, citing securities fraud. In a settlement of that lawsuit, Mr. Musk agreed to step down as chairman and to get a lawyer to review written communications, including posts on Twitter, in which he made material statements about the company. At a hearing two weeks ago on the S.E.C.’s request that Mr. Musk be held in contempt, Judge Alison J. Nathan of Federal District Court in Manhattan told the two sides to “take a deep breath” and put on “their reasonableness pants” to settle the matter, setting Thursday as the deadline. In a submission approved by Judge Nathan on Thursday, the adversaries said that “while we have not reached an agreement,” they had conferred by phone for more than an hour this week “and are continuing to discuss potential resolution.” They said they would report back to the court by next Thursday “indicating whether we have reached an agreement in principle.” The talks are going on as Tesla prepares for two important public presentations next week. On Monday, the company plans to outline its efforts to develop self-driving cars in a bid to convince Wall Street analysts that it has a competitive lead in that technology. On Wednesday, the carmaker will report its first-quarter results. Mr. Musk has said the company lost money in the quarter, after posting profits in the third and fourth quarters of 2018. Tesla’s sales slowed sharply in the first three months of the year. The company delivered just 63,000 vehicles, a drop of 31 percent from the last three months of 2018. The decline seems to show that demand has softened in the United States and that the company has not been able to ramp up sales in Europe and China as quickly as it had hoped to because of logistical challenges. In recent weeks Tesla has shifted sales strategies several times, announcing it would close most showrooms before reversing course, and cutting prices only to raise them days later. In the latest course correction, Tesla said last week that it would end online sales of the long-awaited $35,000 version of its Model 3 sedan, which it announced with great fanfare just a few weeks earlier.

The 47-year-old Tesla entrepreneur updated his profile picture to a snap of an Exmoor Horn Ram taken in Devon in 1962. Last year the image became an internet hit after the Museum of English Rural Life shared the image with the caption 'Look at this absolute unit', a popular online saying. The phrase 'absolute unit' - which Musk now uses to describe himself in his Twitter bio - is a complimentary way to describe large or intimidating people, animals or things, either sincerely or ironically. The Museum of English Rural Life, a branch of the University of Reading, noted Musk's peculiar choice of display picture and tweeted at him saying: 'Excuse us @elonmusk but what'. The account then changed their Twitter picture to one of the SpaceX CEO and altered its Twitter handle to 'The Muskeum of Elongish Rural Life'. Elon Musk's account, pictured left, and the Twitter page for The Museum of English Rural Life, right, exchanged display pictures in a bizarre internet encounter In April 2018 the museum tweeted out this picture of an Exmoor Horn Ram, labelling the animal an 'absolute unit' - an online phrase used to describe large or intimidating beings Revealing the switch following Musk's picture change, the museum tweeted out a picture saying 'Two can play at this game', and the account later posted: 'Next step, The Museum of Mars Rural Life'. The account also told the South Africa-born billionaire he could 'keep the absolute unit' as his profile picture as long as he came along to judge sheep at the Berkshire Show, adding that he could 'fire the winner into space'. Adam Koszary, who runs the museum's Twitter page, told MailOnline: 'Elon likes memes and someone dared him to change his profile picture to the sheep. 'We figured if he was going to masquerade as our ram we were going to masquerade as him. Just silly really.' When asked why he thought the 'absolute unit' ram tweet last year was such a success, he said: 'Because it really is an impressive ram, and people don't expect museums to be using memes like we do (and especially with a name likes ours). The 'absolute unit' phrase is used to describe people or things that are noticeably large 'People just wanted to come together to celebrate an impressive ram.' Mr Koszary, the Museum's Partnership Reading Programme Manager and Digital Lead, said the social media success of their platform has helped get people interested in English rural life. 'We've had more visitors and now a billionaire follows us,' he said, but added that he wished people would stop mistaking them for the real Elon Musk 'and asking us to send them free Teslas'. Musk has a history of engaging in internet humour on his Twitter page, which he has used to proclaim his love of anime along with promoting his business ventures. In February this year Musk featured as a guest host on Meme Review, a show created by popular YouTuber PewDiePie. In March Musk released a bizarre rap song about Harambe - the gorilla who became a pop culture phenomenon after he was shot dead by Cincinnati Zoo officials when a three-year-old boy climbed into his enclosure in 2016. The Tesla billionaire shared a link to the heavily auto-tuned track titled 'RIP Harambe' on Soundcloud, featuring lyrics such as 'We love you Harambe' and 'Sipping on some Bombay'.",bizarre exchange elon musk uk farming museum,elon musk become known engaging peculiar online humour social media elon musk engaged peculiar exchange museum changing twitter image sheep tesla entrepreneur updated profile picture snap exmoor horn ram taken devon last year image became internet hit museum english rural life shared image caption absolute unit popular online saying phrase unit musk uses describe twitter bio complimentary way describe large intimidating people animals things either sincerely ironically museum english rural life branch university reading noted musk peculiar choice display picture tweeted saying us elonmusk account changed twitter picture one spacex ceo altered twitter handle muskeum elongish rural life elon musk account pictured left twitter page museum english rural life right exchanged display pictures bizarre internet encounter april museum tweeted picture exmoor horn ram labelling animal unit online phrase used describe large intimidating beings revealing switch following musk picture change museum tweeted picture saying play game account later posted step museum mars rural life account also told south billionaire could absolute unit profile picture long came along judge sheep berkshire show adding could winner space adam koszary runs museum twitter page told mailonline likes memes someone dared change profile picture sheep figured going masquerade ram going masquerade silly really asked thought unit ram tweet last year success said really impressive ram people expect museums using memes like especially name likes unit phrase used describe people things noticeably large wanted come together celebrate impressive ram mr koszary museum partnership reading programme manager digital lead said social media success platform helped get people interested english rural life visitors billionaire follows us said added wished people would stop mistaking real elon musk asking us send free teslas musk history engaging internet humour twitter page used proclaim love anime along promoting business ventures february year musk featured guest host meme review show created popular youtuber pewdiepie march musk released bizarre rap song harambe gorilla became pop culture phenomenon shot dead cincinnati zoo officials boy climbed enclosure tesla billionaire shared link heavily track titled harambe soundcloud featuring lyrics love harambe bombay

A third of the money is coming from Softbank's Venture Fund, Uber said, confirming earlier reports that the Japanese investor was interested in a stake, with the other two-thirds coming from Toyota and DENSO Corporation. The round leaves ATG at a post-money valuation of $7.25 billion, Uber said, and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2019. ""This investment and our strong partnership with the Toyota Group are a testament to the incredible work of our ATG team to date, and the exciting future ahead for this important project, alongside great partners,"" CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a press release. ""The development of automated driving technology will transform transportation as we know it, making our streets safer and our cities more livable. Today's announcement, along with our ongoing OEM and supplier relationships, will help maintain Uber's position at the forefront of that transformation.""  Self-driving is notoriously expense to develop, as most companies working on the technology have found, and Uber is no exception. However, autonomy is also key to Uber's pitch to investors as it begins the roadshow of its initial public offering this month. In initial filings this month, the company revealed that paying drivers was among its top expenses — removing them from the equation could help Uber reach profitability. ""While we believe that autonomous vehicles present substantial opportunities, the development of such technology is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful,"" Uber said in its S-1 filing. ""Several other companies ... are also developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the personal mobility, meal delivery, or logistics industries. We expect certain competitors to commercialize autonomous vehicle technologies at scale before we do.""

""We should think of the future as public transit together with self-driving vehicles to empower people to go from point A to point B - cheap and in a timely fashion."" Friday's investment will help the group continue its development until full self-driving technology is ready to launch. Urtasun warned that could be more than a decade away.

Over 15 years ago, he made the case that we are all living in a Matrix-like simulation run by another civilization. The idea, though difficult to swallow, is well-regarded by some philosophers, and has even been sanctioned by Elon Musk. Many years later, Bostrom isn't done outlining frightening scenarios. On Wednesday, he took the stage at the TED 2019 conference in Vancouver, Canada, to discuss another radical theory. While speaking to head of the conference, Chris Anderson, Bostrom argued that mass surveillance could be one of the only ways to save humanity from ultimate doom. Read more: We asked a physicist if we live in 'The Matrix' — and he said the odds look good His theory starts with a metaphor of humans standing in front of a giant urn filled with balls that represent ideas. There are white balls (beneficial ideas), grey balls (moderately harmful ideas), and black balls (ideas that destroy civilization). The creation of the atomic bomb, for instance, was akin to a grey ball — a dangerous idea that didn't result in our demise. Bostrom posits that there many be only one black ball in the urn, but, once it is selected, it cannot be put back. (Humanity would be annihilated, after all.) Bostrom explains his ""giant urn"" theory to the head of TED, Chris Anderson.
Bret Hartman/TED According to Bostrom, the only reason that we haven't selected a black ball yet is because we've been ""lucky."" Even global warming, he said, ""could have been a lot worse than it is."" Bostrom thinks the ball that could destroy civilization will be a technology of our own creation. So naturally, he said, we should prevent the technology from existing by surveilling ourselves. Under Bostrom's vision of mass surveillance, humans would be monitored at all times via artificial intelligence, which would send information to ""freedom centers"" that work to save us from doom. To make this possible, he said, all humans would have to wear necklaces, or ""freedom tags,"" with multi-directional cameras. The idea is controversial under any circumstance, but especially at TED, which has focused this year on strategies to ensure privacy in the digital era. Even Bostrom recognizes that the scenario could go horribly wrong. ""Obviously there are huge downsides and indeed massive risks to mass surveillance and global governance,"" he told the crowd. But he still thinks the ends might justify the means. ""On an individual level, we seem to be kind of doomed anyway,"" he said.",oxford philosopher inspired elon musk thinks mass surveillance might way save humanity doom,philosopher nick bostrom known making scary predictions humanity years ago made case living simulation run another civilization idea though difficult swallow philosophers even sanctioned elon musk many years later bostrom done outlining frightening scenarios wednesday took stage ted conference vancouver canada discuss another radical theory speaking head conference chris anderson bostrom argued mass surveillance could one ways save humanity ultimate doom read asked physicist live matrix said odds look good theory starts metaphor humans standing front giant urn filled balls represent ideas white balls beneficial ideas grey balls moderately harmful ideas black balls ideas destroy civilization creation atomic bomb instance akin grey ball dangerous idea result demise bostrom posits many one black ball urn selected put back humanity would annihilated bostrom explains giant urn theory head ted chris anderson bret according bostrom reason selected black ball yet lucky even global warming said could lot worse bostrom thinks ball could destroy civilization technology creation naturally said prevent technology existing surveilling bostrom vision mass surveillance humans would monitored times via artificial intelligence would send information freedom centers work save us doom make possible said humans would wear necklaces freedom tags cameras idea controversial circumstance especially ted focused year strategies ensure privacy digital era even bostrom recognizes scenario could go horribly wrong obviously huge downsides indeed massive risks mass surveillance global governance told crowd still thinks ends might justify means individual level seem kind doomed anyway said

Amazon, Boeing, Microsoft and ExxonMobil are among more than 140 S&P 500 companies reporting quarterly results. According to Refinitiv, 74% of the companies reporting so far have beaten expectations. Based on forecasts and actual reports, earnings for the S&P 500 as a whole are expected to decline 1.7%, the first negative quarter in three years. Some forecasters had projected an earnings decline of 4% or more. The equivalent of the economy's first-quarter report card will be released Friday, with the first reading of GDP. The outlook for first-quarter growth has suddenly shifted upward, after a series of better data releases later in the quarter. CNBC/Moody's Analytics Rapid Update survey shows economists' median forecast is now tracking at 2.4%, way above the 1% expected earlier in the quarter, when severe winter weather and the government shutdown were stifling the economy. At the same time, investors are feeling better about global growth and far less fearful of a recession in the near term. One reason is that China's data has also been picking up. This past week, China reported first-quarter GDP at 6.4%, slightly better than the 6.3% expected by economists. ""I think a lot of this is leveraged on economic activity. I think investors have kind of gotten past this notion of global downturn. The China number was pretty good earlier in the week. I do think next week is going to be important for earnings. We're going to get a great cross section of industries,"" said Jack Ablin, CIO at Cresset Wealth Advisors. On Wednesday, China's first quarter GDP U.S. trade talks with China could be also important in the week ahead, with negotiations continuing and investors awaiting news of a summit between President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping. Dan Suzuki, portfolio strategist at Richard Bernstein Advisors, said he still sees deteriorating fundamentals for both earnings and the economy, even though data appears to be improving. ""I think it's a function of expectations were probably dropping too quickly, and I think recent data is telling you that growth isn't collapsing but it's slowing,"" he said. ""I think that's very important. That's probably going to be the most important dynamic. That's probably going to continue."" That could make for a choppier market at some point, he said. Suzuki said he could see stocks ending the year higher than current levels but he expects to see the market pull back first. The market shrugged off Thursday's release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Trump campaign and Russian election interference. ""This type of thing firmly falls into the category of it can move the needle for the market on a daily or weekly performance basis, but it's not going to be a longer term story for the market,"" Suzuki said. Analysts have said the economy's performance is more important for Trump's reelection than the report at this point.

suggestion
from a Twitter follower, Musk went ahead and made the image of the large sheep his Twitter avatar. The sheep photo, along with the ""absolute unit"" caption, actually came from an
earlier tweet
posted by The Museum of English Rural Life. When the museum discovered Musk’s post, it changed its avatar to a pic of the billionaire. It also changed its Twitter name to ""The Muskeum of Elonglish Rural Life."" Sure, ok. Musk was clearly amused by this all when he found out and, basically, couldn’t stop tweeting about sheep last night. Finally, Elon Musk pivoted from sheep tweets to posts about the

Musk and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) met by phone for ""over an hour"" as ordered by Judge Alison Nathan earlier in April, the two parties said in a joint filing. ""While we have not reached an agreement, counsel for the SEC, Mr. Musk, and counsel for Tesla met and conferred for over an hour by telephone earlier this week and are continuing to discuss potential resolution,"" the filing reads. If a resolution is reached next week, it could finally draw to a close Musk's months-long tussle with federal regulators. Musk originally sparked the conflict back in September, when he tweeted that he was consider taking Tesla private at $420 per share, adding that funding was secured. Funding was anything but secured, it was later revealed, and the kerfuffle resulted in two, $20 million settlements between both Tesla and Musk with the SEC. Musk also agreed to have his tweets monitored by a company employee, but Tesla has not disclosed who that ""twitter sitter"" is. That was fine, until Musk tweeted on February 19 that Tesla would make 500,000 cars in 2019— a substantial deviation from what the company had told investors in its regulatory filings. Despite a correction about four hours later that morning, the SEC accused Musk of violating the agreement and asked the court to find him in contempt of court. That motion is what brought Musk to a Manhattan court room in April, when a judge ordered both him and the SEC to put on their 'reasonableness pants' and come to a new agreement, which is now due on Thursday, April 25.

Thanks for reading. Please share this newsletter and tell your friends they can subscribe here. If you have tips or feedback, just reply to this email. Quick note: I'll be off next week so you'll see me in your inbox again on May 1. Today Expert Voices contributor Henry Claypool writes about what the accessibility issues of today's ridesharing vehicles could mean for tomorrow's AVs. Tesla — whose CEO Elon Musk recently suggested victory in the self-driving car race — plans to pull back the curtain on its Autopilot technology for investors next week. Why it matters: Many technological and regulatory hurdles remain before automated cars can be deemed ready to replace human drivers. Musk's claim runs the risk of confusing consumers — and frustrating regulators. What's happening: Tesla is inviting investors to its Palo Alto headquarters Monday for test drives to experience automated features still under development. My thought bubble: The timing matters — Tesla's first quarter earnings report is expected on Wednesday and the company has a history of touting product news just ahead of poor financial results. One analyst predicts the company's earnings for the first part of the year could be an ""outright disaster."" Details: Tesla declined to comment ahead of the presentation, but Musk himself provided a roadmap in a fascinating podcast interview last week with MIT researcher Lex Fridman. Tesla will no doubt showcase the arrival of a new proprietary computer chip, 3 years in development, that Musk says outfits the cars with ""full self-driving"" hardware.
The chip is ""an order of magnitude"" more powerful than the Nvidia processor it replaces.
""The thing that's really profound ... is that the cars currently being produced, with the hardware currently being produced, [are] capable of full self driving,"" he told Fridman.
""To me, right now, this seems game, set, match."" Reality check: Adding a powerful computer chip does not mean the cars are ready to drive themselves. Musk says Tesla still has to develop software that extends current highway driving capabilities to city streets, including traffic light recognition, complex intersections and remote parking. None of this is easy. If it were, Waymo and GM Cruise would be operating driverless taxi services by now.
But Musk says Autopilot software is improving exponentially. ""If you buy a Tesla today I believe you are buying an appreciating asset, not a depreciating asset."" Tesla has one big advantage over rivals — the massive amounts of data collected from the more than 400,000 sensor-equipped Tesla vehicles already on the road. With the hardware now complete, achieving full self-driving capability is ""just a simple exercise in mathematics,"" writes Rahul Sonnad, co-founder and CEO of Tesloop, an independent ride-sharing company that specializes in Teslas. Yes, but: The potential ambiguity of ""full self-driving"" capability has other AI experts worried. ""With the current Autopilot, everybody knows they need to pay attention. But if all of a sudden, they put in somebody's brain that these cars can drive themselves, I think that is irresponsible,"" says Alain Kornhauser, chair of the AV engineering program at Princeton University.
Two federal agencies are already investigating several Tesla accidents to determine whether Autopilot poses ""an unreasonable risk to safety"" by failing to account for the misuse of the technology.
Meanwhile, some safety advocates have raised questions about regulators' transparency when evaluating Tesla vehicles. The bottom line: Despite his confidence, Musk's claims are under scrutiny, not only because Tesla has missed deadlines before but also due to open regulatory questions. Go deeper Zipcar, the world's largest car-sharing network, is preparing for the day that consumers don't have to walk to find their shared rental car, but instead it comes to find them. The big picture: Zipcar is the original auto-industry disruptor, giving customers on-demand access to vehicles as a viable alternative to car ownership. But the 19-year-old company faces competition from new mobility services including peer-to-peer car-sharing networks like Turo — and even driverless taxis some day. But it has 3 advantages the newcomers lack, Zipcar president Tracey Zhen tells me: Why it matters: All that experience will be important in an AV world, she says. The vehicle use cases won't change, even if there's no one behind the wheel. Even as ridesharing companies expand their offerings and look towards AV deployment, many people with disabilities are still unable to access today's shared vehicles, Henry Claypool writes for Axios Expert Voices. Why it matters: Ridesharing companies, such as Uber and Lyft, formed their business models and then — belatedly, critics allege — began addressing accessibility challenges. That strategy could hinder disability access to AVs in the future. The big picture: Ridesharing companies have promoted the idea that they are a transportation boon to people with disabilities, just as AV companies are doing today. But ridesharing has had mixed results for people with disabilities. For many who cannot get a driver's license because of epilepsy, for example, ridesharing has increased mobility.
Drivers sometimes do not allow service animals into the car, though, which can result in drivers refusing service to people who are blind.
Wheelchair accessible vehicles (WAVs) are unavailable via ridesharing in most markets, or available in few numbers, which can result in lengthy wait times. What's happening: Ridesharing companies have adopted policies that punish drivers for discriminating against people with disabilities. However, the companies still argue that they merely connect people seeking rides to people who operate vehicles, taking little responsibility for the quality of service that drivers provide. What to watch: How Uber and Lyft prioritize and address accessibility now will have lasting impacts as they expand their transportation offerings, including introducing AVs. Uber’s recent launch of limited WAV service in certain markets is a step forward, but still does not offer equal access for all.
Ridesharing companies need to expand access to new mobility options as they develop and deploy them — otherwise, access to new transportation tech will remain unequal. Claypool is a policy expert affiliated with UCSF and AAPD, and a former director of the U.S. Health and Human Services Office on Disability. Funding secured: Uber raises $1 billion for self-driving car unit (Kia Kokalitcheva— Axios) Why it matters: The investment from Softbank and Toyota allows Uber to transfer some of the substantial cost of developing self-driving cars to outside investors. That could help ease investor concerns ahead of its upcoming IPO. Robo-rigs: The Scientist, The Unicorn And The $700 Billion Race To Create Self-Driving Semi-Trucks (Alan Ohnsman — Forbes) The big picture: Propelled by a shortage of 60,000 truck drivers, autonomous trucking firms like Xiaodi Hou's TuSimple could become a commercial success on long-haul highway routes long before Waymo, Cruise and other robotaxi firms can safely deploy driverless cars on city streets. Ghost driver: Phantom Auto closes Series A funding, expands plans for remote-controlled autonomous vehicles (Phil LeBeau — CNBC) Details: The money will help Phantom Auto expand development of technology that allows remote drivers to operate vehicles or robots from thousands of miles away. This week I'm driving the 2019 BMW X7, the newest and largest SUV in the German luxury manufacturer's lineup, with a sticker price of $85,445. Why it matters: BMW is best known for producing ultimate driving machines, so I zeroed in on the ample driver-assistance features in this jumbo-size Bimmer to see how well the machine actually does the driving. Details: Besides standard driver-assistance warnings for blind-spot detection, lane departure and front and rear collision, the X7 xDrive40i also comes with BMW's $1,700 Drivers Assistance Pro package. The package includes an active lane-keeping feature for highway driving and can assist in stop-and-go traffic up to 37 miles per hour.
The system uses a driver-facing camera in the instrument cluster to monitor the driver’s eye and nose position to determine if the person is paying attention.
As long as they're attentive, they can take their hands off the wheel for 30 to 50 seconds at a time. The bottom line: Compared to other driver-assistance technologies I've tried, the BMW X7 seemed heavy-handed. I often felt like I was competing for control, rather than being assisted. But the traffic jam assistance was a welcome relief when we hit heavy traffic outside Toronto. One other fun feature: The X7 also has the gesture-control feature introduced on the BMW 7 Series sedan, which lets you adjust the audio volume with the twirl of a finger. We had fun talking with our hands and playing around with different gestures to see what would happen. But in the end, we were left wondering: What's wrong with a knob?",axios autonomous vehicles april axios,good morning thanks reading please share newsletter tell friends subscribe tips feedback reply

This time, Depp, 55, is suing his former law firm for $30million over claims of negligence. The firm - Bloom Hergott Diemer Rosenthal LaViolette Feldman Schenkman & Goodman - says Depp has recently accused them of malpractice in connection with his divorce from Heard and therefore will need to depose the actress in order to build a defense in the case. The firm asks that the plaintiffs - named as Depp and his film companies Scaramanga Bros and Infinitum Nihil, respond in writing to their questions – and demand the ability to ask Depp more questions over his 'newly articulated theories'. Johnny Depp is suing his former law firm, Bloom Hergott Diemer Rosenthal LaViolette Feldman Schenkman & Goodman, for $30million and says he would be providing information that would make 'all aspects of the malpractice claim… very clear' Amber Heard will need to be deposed in order to build a defense in the case after Depp accused the firm of negligence and malpractice in dealing with his divorce from Heard, which was finalized in 2017 Bloom & Co previously told the court that Depp had failed to supply documents and information, and while the judge ordered the star to give more detailed answers to a number of questions, he denied some of the firm's demands. The new filing reads: 'This is not idle speculation: for example, in the last three months, Plaintiffs have begun to accuse Defendants of malpractice in connection with Depp's divorce from Amber Heard. 'Plaintiffs' supplemental written discovery responses should clarify whether (or how) Plaintiffs believe Defendants were responsible for the purported mismanagement of Depp's divorce (even though Depp had separate counsel in that divorce proceeding).' Heard filed for divorce in 2016 and it was finalized in 2017, with the actress receiving $7million. She and Depp are shown in February 2016 On March 29, Depp's lawyer told the court that he would be providing information that would make 'all aspects of the malpractice claim… very clear'. Bloom & Co say that this means they 'will then need to conduct additional discovery regarding those other aspects, such as documents and depositions from Depp's divorce attorneys, Ms. Heard, and numerous witnesses to incidents allegedly occurring between Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard, in order to defend themselves from charges that they were somehow responsible for Mr. Depp's divorce settlement'. Heard filed for divorce from Depp in May 2016 stating that he had been 'verbally and physically' abusive towards her. Their divorce was finalized in January 2017, with the actress receiving a $7million settlement. The request, filed on Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, also asks for 'a new trial date that reflects the reality of the status of discovery and document productions in the case'. The case was due in court on September 16 after being pushed back from May 6. Bloom & Co. now want the case to be pushed back again, suggesting that it would take them at least six months to prepare, and calling the September date 'unrealistic'. Depp also accused his former attorneys of conspiring with his ex-business managers, The Management Group (TMG), to cheat him out of millions, blaming Bloom & Co. for allegedly failing to alert him to their actions despite knowing what was going on. The lawyers say that TMG has been slow to produce an estimated 1.5 million documents that they need to build their defense, despite requesting the paperwork in November 2017. It reads: 'Plaintiffs consistently refused to produce these documents, but have now finally agreed to produce nearly all of the documents (though not documents relating to a SEC investigation of TMG) produced in the TMG litigation.' The law firm is also requesting to depose Johnny Depp; his sister Christi Dembrowski; his current manager Edward White and others who worked for him. Last month, a judge ordered that Depp's case against his lawyers be pushed back in order to provide more time to submit testimonies and 'unwind the actor's tangled affairs'. The judge warned both sides could have moved quicker and have caused the case to drag on by engaging in 'a great deal of finger-pointing concerning whose fault it is'. Depp's lawyer, Adam Waldman, told The Blast: 'Bloom is accused among other things of a failure to supervise the fraudulent activity of the Mandel Brothers/TMG, Mr. Depp's former business managers who are under multiple federal criminal investigations and whose offices were raided by the FBI in June 2017. 'Judge Green agreed to move their trial from May to September, and ruled that Bloom is entitled to Mandel's sealed documents.' Waldman also slammed the lawyers for their behavior during Johnny's divorce from Heard.    Depp was meant to face his legal team on May 6 but the date has now been pushed back to September 16. Bloom & Co now want the case to be pushed back again, saying it would take them at least six months to prepare to dispute Depp's 'newly articulated theories', revealed in court documents obtained by DailyMail.com Waldman added: 'Part of Bloom's defense is that he did a good job on Mr. Depp's divorce. But the facts are these: some of Mr. Depp's legal dream team of five Hollywood lawyers reviewed the entire surveillance video library taken of Ms. Heard, her friends, Elon Musk and others captured by 24 surveillance cameras in the Eastern Columbia Building and the 87 surveillance videos that these lawyers set aside. 'Then Mr. Depp's lawyers took sworn declarations from multiple eyewitnesses. Some on Mr. Depp's legal team secretly represented Elon Musk. Some of Mr. Depp's legal team then hid for nearly three years this exculpatory evidence from Mr. Depp that disproved the malicious hoax perpetrated against him by Amber Heard.' Bloom & Co. have denied all allegations of wrongdoing and insisted they never conspired against the actor. They have filed a countersuit, accusing Depp of causing his own damages due to his own misconduct and negligence, claiming he hadn't paid them for months, despite the lawyers continuing to work for him. The actor denied owing any money, claiming he had paid tens of millions over the years and argued the firm are barred from trying to collect unpaid dues because they never signed an official retainer, describing their agreement as 'illegal'. Depp has also has filed a $50million defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife, 32, in which he claims her accusations of domestic abuse were an 'elaborate hoax'. His legal team have apparently interviewed a number people under oath, who all claimed they saw no visible injuries on Heard when they interacted with her following an alleged altercation. In transcripts obtained by The Blast, four employees and one neighbor from the couple's former apartment building were deposed and asked about any sign of abuse they may have seen between the pair and all insisted there were none. Trinity Esparaza, who owns the building's concierge services company, encountered the actress a number of times following an alleged incident on May 21, including two days afterwards, when she did not see any visible injuries to Amber's face or body. But she noted on May 27 - the day the Aquaman star filed for a temporary restraining order and accused her then-husband of spousal abuse - that she was sporting a 'red cut underneath her right eye and red marks by her eye'. After seeing pictures which were released when Amber filed for the order against Johnny, Trinity went back and reviewed security footage from the building because she suspected the allegations were 'false' as the 'time didn't add up' and she had seen the actress 'several times' without marks on her face. In her legal filings against Depp, Heard attached these photos of the injuries she says she suffered at the hands of her ex-husband This is one of the clumps of hair left on the ground after Depp pulled it from her hair during a December 2015 fight, she claimed Heard was left with a hole in her scalp after being repeatedly punched in the back of the head, she said Security guard Alex Romero also admitted he had serious doubts about Amber's account because he had seen her a number of times during the week and saw nothing to suggest the actress had been 'punched by anyone' or had anything thrown at her. Heard and Depp were married for just 15 months when they split and he is suing her for $50million over defamation He added: 'I saw the pictures and the next day I saw her. I was like come on, really. I couldn't believe. When I saw her in person, I didn't see anything.' Two other employees, including the building's general manager Brandon Patterson - also testified they had seen the actress multiple times after the alleged assault and was seen 'without bruises, cuts, redness, swelling or any other injuries to her face'. And the couple's neighbour, Isaac Baruch - who has been friends with the Black Mass actor for 37 years - told how he saw Amber the morning after the alleged fight and claims she shouted: 'He hit me! He threw a phone and hit me!' While the actress 'stretched her neck' to show him her alleged injuries, he didn't see anything and though he saw her mark-free throughout the week, on May 27, there were visible marks on her. Johnny's attorney has also provided 87 different pieces of recorded video, taken from different cameras before and after the alleged incident. Amber's lawyer has branded the lawsuit 'frivolous' and insisted his client won't be silenced. The latest news comes after Johnny accused Amber of starting a relationship with Elon Musk just a month after they married in 2015. In the lawsuit obtained by People, the actor alleged that Heard would receive 'late night' visits from Musk while Depp was out of the country filming. Depp also claims that the Tesla founder was allowed into the couple's Los Angeles home on the same night Heard 'presented her battered face to the public'. Heard and Depp separated in May 2016. According to People, a representative for Musk claims that 'Elon and Amber didn't start seeing each other until May 2016'. 'Their relationship didn't become romantic until sometime later,' the representative said. Heard's attorney, Eric M. George, said in a statement to the magazine: 'This frivolous action is just the latest of Johnny Depp's repeated efforts to silence Amber Heard. 'She will not be silenced. Mr. Depp's actions prove he is unable to accept the truth of his ongoing abusive behavior.' Johnny Depp allegedly destroyed the $3million penthouse wife Amber Heard used as a closet (above) during a fight in Match 2015, according to a court filing DailyMail.com obtained photos of the wreckage which show broken racks and designer clothing and accessories scattered around the room (above) Kevin, who worked for the building where Depp was living at the time, wrote that he will deal with the situation, prompting the other individual to text: 'Insanity. Just f***ing insanity' (above) Last December, Heard wrote an article for the Washington Post in which she said she had received death threats and lost out on work after accusing Depp of domestic abuse. 'The op-ed's clear implication that Mr Depp is a domestic abuser is categorically and demonstrably false,' Depp's lawsuit states. 'Mr Depp never abused Ms Heard. Her allegations against him were false when they were made in 2016. 'They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms Heard and advance her career.' The lawsuit goes on to say that the allegations made by Heard against Depp were refuted by 'two separate responding police officers, a litany of neutral third-party witnesses, and 87 newly obtained surveillance camera videos'. 'Ms Heard is not a victim of domestic abuse, she is a perpetrator,' the lawsuit states. The Aquaman actress filed for divorce from the Pirates of the Caribbean star in May 2016 stating that he had been 'verbally and physically' abusive towards her. Their divorce was finalized in January 2017, with Heard later donating a portion of her $7million divorce settlement to the Children's Hospital Los Angeles. They were married for 15 months before she filed for divorce. Images emerged at the time showing Heard with a bruised eye and face. She claimed Depp threw a phone at her face and struck her in their home. Depp has long denied the allegations and has instead claimed that his ex-wife repeatedly violently attacked and severely injured him. In the defamation lawsuit, Depp claims Heard threw a glass vodka bottle at him and caused the bones in the tip of his right middle finger to shatter. He claims the incident occurred one month into their marriage and resulted in him having to have his finger 'surgically reattached'. 'Ms Heard then disseminated false accounts of this incident, casting Mr Depp as the perpetrator of his own injury'. Depp claims in the lawsuit that he was dropped from Pirates of the Caribbean just four days after Heard's op-ed was published in the Washington Post.

Attorney General William Barr refused to grant this request, which has only enflamed Democrats after reports emerged in recent weeks that members of Mueller's team disputed Barr's brief summation of the report.

But it confirms Mueller did not feel he was in a position to make a judgment on the issue of obstruction. The ball is now in congressional Democrats' court. Here's what happens next. ""Subpoenas are coming."" That was the jocular ""Game of Thrones""-themed message Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu sent to Trump via Twitter on Friday morning after the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed ""the complete and unredacted version"" of the Mueller report. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said in a statement, ""My Committee needs and is entitled to the full version of the report and the underlying evidence consistent with past practice. The redactions appear to be significant. We have so far seen none of the actual evidence that the Special Counsel developed to make this case.""

""It now falls to Congress to determine the full scope of that alleged misconduct and to decide what steps we must take going forward."" Nadler said the committee expects the full unredacted report to be delivered by the Justice Department by May 1. Starting Monday, some members of Congress will also have the opportunity to see a less-redacted version of the report in a ""secure reading room."" The Justice Department has asked these lawmakers to keep the information they see confidential. Barr is set to testify on the Mueller report before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 1 and before the House Judiciary Committee on May 2. Given the scrutiny Barr has faced over his depiction of the report and handling of its rollout, he can expect tough questions from congressional Democrats. Nadler has also called on Mueller to testify before the House Judiciary Committee no later than May 23.

Brad Buss and Linda Johnson Rice will not pursue reelection to the board at Tesla's stockholders' meeting this June. And in 2020, Steve Jurvetson's tenure will officially end. Jurvetson has been on leave following accusations of sexual misconduct at his venture-capital firm Draper, Fisher, Jurvetson in 2017. A fourth independent director, Antonio Gracias, will also bow out in 2020 if Tesla stockholders approve a proposal to reduce director terms from three years to two. If that proposal fails, Gracias would exit in 2021, the electric-car maker said. Tesla's board of directors has grown from seven to 11 members in the last five years. The company said the new changes would ""streamline"" the group and ""allow it to operate more efficiently and nimbly.""

This latest shuffle comes amid what has already been a turbulent year for Tesla and CEO Elon Musk, who has repeatedly locked horns with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The parties are negotiating the terms governing the chief executive's use of public social-media platforms to make statements about Tesla. Those talks stem from a dispute over previous statements Musk has made online that federal regulators say contained material information about Tesla that were not vetted internally before publication or contradicted facts and figures already shared with investors.

The electric-car maker said that it wants to ""streamline"" corporate oversight because its board has grown by four members over the past five years. That has led to ""the duplication of certain areas of experience or expertise"" among its directors, the company said in a filing. Now Tesla is shaking things up to allow the board to ""operate more nimbly and efficiently."" Two directors have agreed not to stand for reelection at Tesla's annual meeting this year, and two more will leave in 2020 or 2021. ""Such agreements did not result from any disagreement between Tesla and any of such directors,"" the company said. Cautious Tesla investors have also been pleading for with the company to tighten oversight of CEO Elon Musk. The disclosure comes just four months after Tesla added two new board members as part of a settlement deal that Musk and Tesla reached with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency wanted Tesla to put stricter checks on Musk's power after accusing him of misleading investors with his tweets about taking Tesla private. But their dispute is far from over: The SEC has since accused Musk of flouting other settlement terms and is looking to hold him in contempt. Tesla's Friday filings say the outgoing board members include Linda Johnson Rice, the chairman and CEO of Johnson Publishing, who joined the board in 2017. The others — Brad Buss, Antonio Gracias and Steve Jurvetson — have been with the company over nine years. Jurvetson is considered a close ally to Musk. The venture capitalist was one of Tesla's earliest investors, and he's a director at Musk's rocket company, SpaceX. Jurvetson, who is scheduled to depart in 2020, returned to his role at Tesla this month after taking a year-long leave of absence that he began amid reports of inappropriate workplace behavior and harassment. Jurvetson has denied the allegations. A new filing states that the Tesla board is confident that with three remaining independent members, it is ""poised to lead Tesla with fresh perspectives balanced by deep historical knowledge of our company, while maintaining a wealth of diverse experience and expertise."" Critics have said that some of Tesla's ""independent board members"" aren't so independent. Oracle's Larry Ellison, for example, reportedly had close ties to Musk before joining the board. He was one of the members that Tesla brought on to comply with the SEC settlement. Other independent directors include 21st Century Fox's James Murdoch and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, head of global human resources at Walgreens. Wilson-Thompson was the other independent director elected after the SEC settlement. Kimbal Musk, Elon's brother, also has a seat on the board. If shareholders approve a plan to restructure the remaining board seats, director terms will be reduced to two years instead of three.

The outing comes amid news that she is being called to give even more evidence on her messy divorce from Johnny Depp, according to the latest filing in one of the Pirate of the Caribbean star's ongoing legal battles, exclusively obtained by DailyMail.com. The 32-year-old actress was seen being comforted by a male friend outside of the office of her lawyers on Wednesday. Scroll down for video Moving on: Amber Heard was seen exiting an office after a two-hour meeting with her lawyers in Los Angeles on Wednesday There for her: She was given a hug by a male friend after the meeting Tough: Meanwhile there were 10 more videos released from her August 2016 deposition in which she detailed her now-ex's alleged abuse Meanwhile there were 10 more videos released from her August 2016 deposition in which she detailed her now-ex's alleged abuse. Perhaps the most eye-brow raising of all was one in which Heard claims that Depp grabbed her by the hair after throwing a cell phone at the actress hitting her in the eye. Heard seemed visibly shaken and her voice broke a few times as she detailed the alleged incident saying: 'He grabs my head, takes a fist full of my hair and says ""I hit your eye, I hit your eye huh? Let me see your eye, let me see, what if I pulled your hair back? Making moves: She opted for comfort as she left the office building Busy: She also tapped away on her mobile phone Friendly: She chatted away with her pal Nice: The two embraced before going their separate ways Happy: Amber flashed a big smile on the outing 'And he yanks my head back and he's, I don't know, smacking my face or moving my face and he's got me by the hair.' She goes on to say that Depp was screaming in her face while grabbing her and expressed her frustration about no one in the vicinity trying to help. Heard said:  'He's yelling at me, he's screaming about ""let's see how hard I hit you."" And I'm screaming at the top of my lungs: ""help help please help."" I guess I say ""call 911.""' According to the DailyMail.com report Friday, the 55-year-old actor Depp is suing his former law firm for $30million over claims of negligence. Sad: Perhaps the most eye-brow raising of all was one in which Heard claims that Depp grabbed her by the hair after throwing a cell phone at the actress hitting her in the eye Recalling: Heard seemed visibly shaken and her voice broke a few times as she detailed the alleged incident Not a peep: She goes on to say that Depp was screaming in her face while grabbing her and expressed her frustration about no one in the vicinity trying to help The firm - Bloom Hergott Diemer Rosenthal LaViolette Feldman Schenkman & Goodman - says Depp has recently accused them of malpractice in connection with his divorce from Heard and therefore will need to depose the actress in order to build a defense in the case. The firm asks that the plaintiffs - named as Depp and his film companies Scaramanga Bros and Infinitum Nihil, respond in writing to their questions – and demand the ability to ask Depp more questions over his 'newly articulated theories'. Bloom & Co previously told the court that Depp had failed to supply documents and information, and while the judge ordered the star to give more detailed answers to a number of questions, he denied some of the firm's demands. Moving forward: Heard was seen on a solo outing in Los Angeles on Friday The new filing reads: 'This is not idle speculation: for example, in the last three months, Plaintiffs have begun to accuse Defendants of malpractice in connection with Depp's divorce from Amber Heard. 'Plaintiffs' supplemental written discovery responses should clarify whether (or how) Plaintiffs believe Defendants were responsible for the purported mismanagement of Depp's divorce (even though Depp had separate counsel in that divorce proceeding).' On March 29, Depp's lawyer told the court that he would be providing information that would make 'all aspects of the malpractice claim… very clear'. Johnny Depp is suing his former law firm, Bloom Hergott Diemer Rosenthal LaViolette Feldman Schenkman & Goodman, for $30million and says he would be providing information that would make 'all aspects of the malpractice claim… very clear' Amber Heard will need to be deposed in order to build a defense in the case after Depp accused the firm of negligence and malpractice in dealing with his divorce from Heard, which was finalized in 2017 Bloom & Co say that this means they 'will then need to conduct additional discovery regarding those other aspects, such as documents and depositions from Depp's divorce attorneys, Ms. Heard, and numerous witnesses to incidents allegedly occurring between Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard, in order to defend themselves from charges that they were somehow responsible for Mr. Depp's divorce settlement'. Heard filed for divorce from Depp in May 2016 stating that he had been 'verbally and physically' abusive towards her. Their divorce was finalized in January 2017, with the actress receiving a $7million settlement. Heard filed for divorce in 2016 and it was finalized in 2017, with the actress receiving $7million. She and Depp are shown in February 2016 The request, filed on Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, also asks for 'a new trial date that reflects the reality of the status of discovery and document productions in the case'. The case was due in court on September 16 after being pushed back from May 6. Bloom & Co. now want the case to be pushed back again, suggesting that it would take them at least six months to prepare, and calling the September date 'unrealistic'. Depp also accused his former attorneys of conspiring with his ex-business managers, The Management Group (TMG), to cheat him out of millions, blaming Bloom & Co. for allegedly failing to alert him to their actions despite knowing what was going on. The lawyers say that TMG has been slow to produce an estimated 1.5 million documents that they need to build their defense, despite requesting the paperwork in November 2017. It reads: 'Plaintiffs consistently refused to produce these documents, but have now finally agreed to produce nearly all of the documents (though not documents relating to a SEC investigation of TMG) produced in the TMG litigation.' The law firm is also requesting to depose Johnny Depp; his sister Christi Dembrowski; his current manager Edward White and others who worked for him. Last month, a judge ordered that Depp's case against his lawyers be pushed back in order to provide more time to submit testimonies and 'unwind the actor's tangled affairs'. The judge warned both sides could have moved quicker and have caused the case to drag on by engaging in 'a great deal of finger-pointing concerning whose fault it is'. Depp's lawyer, Adam Waldman, told The Blast: 'Bloom is accused among other things of a failure to supervise the fraudulent activity of the Mandel Brothers/TMG, Mr. Depp's former business managers who are under multiple federal criminal investigations and whose offices were raided by the FBI in June 2017. 'Judge Green agreed to move their trial from May to September, and ruled that Bloom is entitled to Mandel's sealed documents.' Waldman also slammed the lawyers for their behavior during Johnny's divorce from Heard.    Depp was meant to face his legal team on May 6 but the date has now been pushed back to September 16. Bloom & Co now want the case to be pushed back again, saying it would take them at least six months to prepare to dispute Depp's 'newly articulated theories', revealed in court documents obtained by DailyMail.com Waldman added: 'Part of Bloom's defense is that he did a good job on Mr. Depp's divorce. But the facts are these: some of Mr. Depp's legal dream team of five Hollywood lawyers reviewed the entire surveillance video library taken of Ms. Heard, her friends, Elon Musk and others captured by 24 surveillance cameras in the Eastern Columbia Building and the 87 surveillance videos that these lawyers set aside. 'Then Mr. Depp's lawyers took sworn declarations from multiple eyewitnesses. Some on Mr. Depp's legal team secretly represented Elon Musk. Some of Mr. Depp's legal team then hid for nearly three years this exculpatory evidence from Mr. Depp that disproved the malicious hoax perpetrated against him by Amber Heard.' Bloom & Co. have denied all allegations of wrongdoing and insisted they never conspired against the actor. They have filed a countersuit, accusing Depp of causing his own damages due to his own misconduct and negligence, claiming he hadn't paid them for months, despite the lawyers continuing to work for him. The actor denied owing any money, claiming he had paid tens of millions over the years and argued the firm are barred from trying to collect unpaid dues because they never signed an official retainer, describing their agreement as 'illegal'. Depp has also has filed a $50million defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife, 32, in which he claims her accusations of domestic abuse were an 'elaborate hoax'. His legal team have apparently interviewed a number people under oath, who all claimed they saw no visible injuries on Heard when they interacted with her following an alleged altercation. In transcripts obtained by The Blast, four employees and one neighbor from the couple's former apartment building were deposed and asked about any sign of abuse they may have seen between the pair and all insisted there were none. Trinity Esparaza, who owns the building's concierge services company, encountered the actress a number of times following an alleged incident on May 21, including two days afterwards, when she did not see any visible injuries to Amber's face or body. But she noted on May 27 - the day the Aquaman star filed for a temporary restraining order and accused her then-husband of spousal abuse - that she was sporting a 'red cut underneath her right eye and red marks by her eye'. After seeing pictures which were released when Amber filed for the order against Johnny, Trinity went back and reviewed security footage from the building because she suspected the allegations were 'false' as the 'time didn't add up' and she had seen the actress 'several times' without marks on her face. In her legal filings against Depp, Heard attached these photos of the injuries she says she suffered at the hands of her ex-husband This is one of the clumps of hair left on the ground after Depp pulled it from her hair during a December 2015 fight, she claimed Heard was left with a hole in her scalp after being repeatedly punched in the back of the head, she said Security guard Alex Romero also admitted he had serious doubts about Amber's account because he had seen her a number of times during the week and saw nothing to suggest the actress had been 'punched by anyone' or had anything thrown at her. Heard and Depp were married for just 15 months when they split and he is suing her for $50million over defamation He added: 'I saw the pictures and the next day I saw her. I was like come on, really. I couldn't believe. When I saw her in person, I didn't see anything.' Two other employees, including the building's general manager Brandon Patterson - also testified they had seen the actress multiple times after the alleged assault and was seen 'without bruises, cuts, redness, swelling or any other injuries to her face'. And the couple's neighbour, Isaac Baruch - who has been friends with the Black Mass actor for 37 years - told how he saw Amber the morning after the alleged fight and claims she shouted: 'He hit me! He threw a phone and hit me!' While the actress 'stretched her neck' to show him her alleged injuries, he didn't see anything and though he saw her mark-free throughout the week, on May 27, there were visible marks on her. Johnny's attorney has also provided 87 different pieces of recorded video, taken from different cameras before and after the alleged incident. Amber's lawyer has branded the lawsuit 'frivolous' and insisted his client won't be silenced. The latest news comes after Johnny accused Amber of starting a relationship with Elon Musk just a month after they married in 2015. In the lawsuit obtained by People, the actor alleged that Heard would receive 'late night' visits from Musk while Depp was out of the country filming. Depp also claims that the Tesla founder was allowed into the couple's Los Angeles home on the same night Heard 'presented her battered face to the public'. Heard and Depp separated in May 2016. According to People, a representative for Musk claims that 'Elon and Amber didn't start seeing each other until May 2016'. 'Their relationship didn't become romantic until sometime later,' the representative said. Heard's attorney, Eric M. George, said in a statement to the magazine: 'This frivolous action is just the latest of Johnny Depp's repeated efforts to silence Amber Heard. 'She will not be silenced. Mr. Depp's actions prove he is unable to accept the truth of his ongoing abusive behavior.' Johnny Depp allegedly destroyed the $3million penthouse wife Amber Heard used as a closet (above) during a fight in Match 2015, according to a court filing DailyMail.com obtained photos of the wreckage which show broken racks and designer clothing and accessories scattered around the room (above) Kevin, who worked for the building where Depp was living at the time, wrote that he will deal with the situation, prompting the other individual to text: 'Insanity. Just f***ing insanity' (above) Last December, Heard wrote an article for the Washington Post in which she said she had received death threats and lost out on work after accusing Depp of domestic abuse. 'The op-ed's clear implication that Mr Depp is a domestic abuser is categorically and demonstrably false,' Depp's lawsuit states. 'Mr Depp never abused Ms Heard. Her allegations against him were false when they were made in 2016. 'They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms Heard and advance her career.' The lawsuit goes on to say that the allegations made by Heard against Depp were refuted by 'two separate responding police officers, a litany of neutral third-party witnesses, and 87 newly obtained surveillance camera videos'. 'Ms Heard is not a victim of domestic abuse, she is a perpetrator,' the lawsuit states. The Aquaman actress filed for divorce from the Pirates of the Caribbean star in May 2016 stating that he had been 'verbally and physically' abusive towards her. Their divorce was finalized in January 2017, with Heard later donating a portion of her $7million divorce settlement to the Children's Hospital Los Angeles. They were married for 15 months before she filed for divorce. Images emerged at the time showing Heard with a bruised eye and face. She claimed Depp threw a phone at her face and struck her in their home. Depp has long denied the allegations and has instead claimed that his ex-wife repeatedly violently attacked and severely injured him. In the defamation lawsuit, Depp claims Heard threw a glass vodka bottle at him and caused the bones in the tip of his right middle finger to shatter. He claims the incident occurred one month into their marriage and resulted in him having to have his finger 'surgically reattached'. 'Ms Heard then disseminated false accounts of this incident, casting Mr Depp as the perpetrator of his own injury'. Depp claims in the lawsuit that he was dropped from Pirates of the Caribbean just four days after Heard's op-ed was published in the Washington Post.

Brad Buss, Antonio Gracias, Stephen Jurvetson, and Linda Johnson Rice will not be standing for re-election in the upcoming annual meetings of stockholders in 2019 and 2020, the company said in a regulatory filing. The company said its directors reviewed the composition of the board ""focusing on a phased streamlining of the size of the Board to allow it to operate more nimbly and efficiently."" Tesla said the decision did not result from any disagreement between the company and the directors. Of the four members who would exit the board, Buss and Gracias were part of Tesla's disclosure controls committee, overseeing the implementation of the terms of the consent agreement between Tesla and the SEC. Buss was also the chief financial officer of solar panel installer SolarCity for two years before retiring in 2016. Tesla bought SolarCity that year. Gracias has been an independent director at Tesla since 2010. Last May, proxy adviser ISS recommended that investors vote against his election to the board and called him a non-independent director. Jurvetson, the co-founder of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, is said to be on a leave of absence from Tesla's board since allegations of sexual harassment against him arose. Jurvetson has denied the allegations against him. The proposed changes in the board come a couple of weeks after Elon Musk's position as the chief executive officer of Tesla was secured after a federal judge urged the billionaire to settle contempt allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over his use of Twitter. Musk was sued by the SEC last year for tweeting that he had ""funding secured"" to take the company private. He settled the lawsuit, agreeing to step down as chairman and have the company's lawyers pre-approve written communications with material information about the company. But he was again accused of violating that settlement by sending a tweet about Tesla's production that had not been vetted by the company's attorneys. On Thursday, a federal judge ruled that Musk and the SEC would get another week to settle a dispute over Musk's use of Twitter.",tesla shrink board seven directors,tesla said friday four members board would leaving next two years electric car company looks streamline board brad buss antonio gracias stephen jurvetson linda johnson rice standing upcoming annual meetings stockholders company said regulatory filing company said directors reviewed composition board focusing phased streamlining size board allow operate nimbly efficiently tesla said decision result disagreement company directors four members would exit board buss gracias part tesla disclosure controls committee overseeing implementation terms consent agreement tesla sec buss also chief financial officer solar panel installer solarcity two years retiring tesla bought solarcity year gracias independent director tesla since last may proxy adviser iss recommended investors vote election board called director jurvetson silicon valley venture capital firm draper fisher jurvetson said leave absence tesla board since allegations sexual harassment arose jurvetson denied allegations proposed changes board come couple weeks elon musk position chief executive officer tesla secured federal judge urged billionaire settle contempt allegations securities exchange commission use twitter musk sued sec last year tweeting funding secured take company private settled lawsuit agreeing step chairman company lawyers written communications material information company accused violating settlement sending tweet tesla production vetted company attorneys thursday federal judge ruled musk sec would get another week settle dispute musk use twitter

Brad Buss, a member of the board since 2009, and Linda Johnson Rice, who joined two years ago, have asked not to be re-elected when shareholders convene on June 11 for Tesla’s annual general meeting, the company said in a preliminary proxy statement. Steve Jurvetson, who just returned from an extended leave of absence, will not seek re-election at the 2020 shareholders’ meeting, the proxy said; Antonio Gracias, a close associate of the chief executive, Elon Musk, intends to leave at the same time, a year before his term ends. Mr. Gracias’s early departure must be approved by shareholders at the June 11 meeting. The departures will reduce the number of directors to seven from 11. Shrinking the board will “allow it to operate more nimbly and efficiently,” the company said. Next week, Tesla is expected to report a loss in the first quarter, when deliveries fell 31 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2018. Analysts will look closely at how much cash the company has on hand. It had $3.7 billion at the end of 2018, but it paid nearly $1 billion to bondholders in March. It recently said it had “sufficient” cash. Tesla is currently valued at $47 billion, more than Ford, but it has yet to turn an annual profit since its founding in 2003. Tesla’s board has come under criticism for directors’ close ties to Mr. Musk. Mr. Gracias and Mr. Jurvetson are also directors of SpaceX, Mr. Musk’s rocket company. Mr. Jurvetson had been on leave since late 2017 after he resigned from his venture-capital firm amid allegations of misconduct. He had denied those allegations. Mr. Buss had for a time served as chief financial officer of SolarCity, the struggling solar-panel maker where Mr. Musk had served as chairman until Tesla acquired the company in 2016. Two other directors are Kimbal Musk, Mr. Musk’s brother and founder of a chain of restaurants, and Ira Ehrenpreis, a SpaceX investor. Mr. Musk stepped down as chairman last year as part of an agreement to settle a securities-fraud lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. He was replaced by Robyn Denholm, who was then a senior executive at an Australian telecommunications company. Tesla’s board is one of the most highly compensated among publicly traded companies. The proxy statement said the 10 directors other than Mr. Musk were given stock options valued at more than $60 million in 2018.",tesla shrink board directors four people,tesla said two directors plan leave board june two intend depart next year part move improve corporate governance electric car company brad buss member board since linda johnson rice joined two years ago asked shareholders convene june tesla annual general meeting company said preliminary proxy statement steve jurvetson returned extended leave absence seek shareholders meeting proxy said antonio gracias close associate chief executive elon musk intends leave time year term ends gracias early departure must approved shareholders june meeting departures reduce number directors seven shrinking board allow operate nimbly efficiently company said next week tesla expected report loss first quarter deliveries fell percent compared fourth quarter analysts look closely much cash company hand billion end paid nearly billion bondholders march recently said sufficient cash tesla currently valued billion ford yet turn annual profit since founding tesla board come criticism directors close ties musk gracias jurvetson also directors spacex musk rocket company jurvetson leave since late resigned firm amid allegations misconduct denied allegations buss time served chief financial officer solarcity struggling maker musk served chairman tesla acquired company two directors kimbal musk musk brother founder chain restaurants ira ehrenpreis spacex investor musk stepped chairman last year part agreement settle lawsuit brought securities exchange commission replaced robyn denholm senior executive australian telecommunications company tesla board one highly compensated among publicly traded companies proxy statement said directors musk given stock options valued million

Electric cars like Rivian, Tesla, Jaguar offer unique storage spaces","What's a frunk? It's a trunk ... under the hood. And several automakers are beginning to offer them in electric cars. The concept is not unheard of. The Volkswagen Beetle, for example, had storage space in the front. (RIP, Beetle.) But electric vehicles don't have a conventional internal combustion engine, and their electric parts can be situated for maximize storage space. It wasn't always this way. The first version of the Chevrolet Volt semi-electric vehicle had only four usable seats because the middle seat in the back had to be warped to make room for the battery pack. But as battery design and performance have advanced, electric cars are getting new storage areas. The Volt, which is being discontinued as GM focuses on pure-electric cars like the Bolt, eventually evolved and got its middle seat back.

It's a key feature on the Model 3 compact sedan, Model S luxury car and Model X SUV.

(AP) — Tesla plans to cut its board of directors from 11 to seven in a move the electric-car maker says will allow the board to act more nimbly and efficiently. Tesla says the four directors who will depart aren’t leaving because of any disagreement with the company. The board has come under closer scrutiny since August, when CEO Elon Musk tweeted that he had lined up funding and was considering taking the Palo Alto, California-based company private at $420 per share. That didn’t happen, and regulators accused Musk of securities fraud. Tesla disclosed the upcoming changes to the board in regulatory filings Friday. Brad Buss, a director since 2009, and Linda Johnson Rice, who joined the board in 2017, plan to leave at the annual meeting in June. Two early Tesla investors, Stephen Jurvetson and Antonio Gracias, plan to leave next year if shareholders agree to shorten Gracias’ term by a year. “This shakeup of the board has been long overdue,” said Stephen Diamond, a corporate-governance expert and associate law professor at Santa Clara University who has urged changes in oversight at the company. “It is a very important step towards greater accountability to Tesla’s owners, the public shareholders, because it breaks up the old-boys network around Elon Musk.” The shareholder meeting is June 11 in Mountain View. Shareholders will vote on other proposals that the company says will improve its corporate governance, including shortening directors’ terms from three years to two years, and dropping a supermajority voting requirement. The changes are the latest moves by Tesla in response to criticism that the board has lacked independence from the company’s mercurial CEO. The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Musk last year, accusing him of misleading investors by falsely claiming in a post to his 22 million Twitter followers that he had arranged funding to take Tesla private. The SEC sought to remove Musk as CEO, but the two sides settled with Tesla agreeing to pay $40 million and have Musk step down as chairman for at least three years. In December, Tesla named two independent board members as part of the agreement. Tesla Inc. shares closed Friday at $273.26 after a gain of $2.03. They have fallen 18% this year and 29% from their peak on Aug. 7, when Musk made his going-private tweet.",tesla wants cut size board directors,palo alto ap tesla plans cut board directors seven move maker says allow board act nimbly efficiently tesla says four directors depart leaving disagreement company board come closer scrutiny since august ceo elon musk tweeted lined funding considering taking palo alto company private per share happen regulators accused musk securities fraud tesla disclosed upcoming changes board regulatory filings friday brad buss director since linda johnson rice joined board plan leave annual meeting june two early tesla investors stephen jurvetson antonio gracias plan leave next year shareholders agree shorten gracias term year shakeup board long overdue said stephen diamond expert associate law professor santa clara university urged changes oversight company important step towards greater accountability tesla owners public shareholders breaks network around elon shareholder meeting june mountain view shareholders vote proposals company says improve corporate governance including shortening directors terms three years two years dropping supermajority voting requirement changes latest moves tesla response criticism board lacked independence company mercurial ceo securities exchange commission sued musk last year accusing misleading investors falsely claiming post million twitter followers arranged funding take tesla private sec sought remove musk ceo two sides settled tesla agreeing pay million musk step chairman least three years december tesla named two independent board members part agreement tesla shares closed friday gain fallen year peak musk made tweet

Inspiration and Tesla Shows Off Self-Driving Cars - The New York Times,"Want this column in your inbox? Sign up here. Need a break from the Mueller report? Or just want a quick rundown of the top headlines in business and tech, plus the big stories to watch in the week ahead? Catch up here. APRIL 14-20 Pinterest Inc., the digital pinboard where you can collect pictures of the life you wish you led, is now providing a new type of inspiration with its highly successful initial public offering. It joined another tech company, Zoom Video Communications, in going public on Thursday, and both finished their first day of trading well above their initial valuations. This is heartening news in Silicon Valley, where a number of other corporations are poised for their own I.P.O.s this year. It also eased fears that the lackluster performance of the ride-hailing company Lyft, the first of its cohort to go public, had scared off would-be tech investors. But Pinterest and Zoom may turn the tide. What forced Apple, one of the world’s biggest companies, to throw in the towel on a multiyear legal battle on Tuesday? Perhaps it had no other choice. The back story: Qualcomm, which holds the patent on the tiny chips that make your iPhone work, was charging royalties on nearly every smartphone sold. Apple objected and refused to pay while continuing to use the chips, so Qualcomm sued. Then, a plot twist: Just as the case went to court this week, Qualcomm’s rival Intel announced its exit from the chip-making business — putting Apple in the awkward position of being totally dependent on Qualcomm for its 5G technology. It was a surprising turn of events (and a great one for Qualcomm), but more important: What’s the future of smartphones if Qualcomm has no competitors? The ubiquitous tabloid The National Enquirer was sold this past week to James Cohen, a son of the founder of Hudson News, the equally ubiquitous airport chain that hawks magazines and gum. The publication has struggled with a string of legal issues stemming from its connections to President Trump (namely that its former chief executive, a longtime ally of Mr. Trump’s, used its resources to bury embarrassing stories about him during his 2016 campaign). More recently, it has been under federal investigation for claims that it threatened to publish lewd photographs of Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos. Mr. Cohen, who has previously done business with The Enquirer’s parent company, reportedly paid $100 million for it, a steep price for the deeply indebted enterprise. He says he plans to use its archive in podcasts and documentaries. APRIL 21-27 Tesla will show off its new self-driving cars to investors at its headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif., on Monday and announce a “road map” for future developments. Although the technology is still in progress, autonomous vehicles will be available for attendees to “test drive” (or test sit, assuming the cars do what they’re supposed to). Is it a coincidence that this event, which will also be webcast for maximum coverage, is taking place two days before Tesla releases its first-quarter earnings, which may not be so great? Probably not. Yes, the United States and China are still hashing out their overdue trade deal. But Washington did win one victory over Beijing on Thursday, when the World Trade Organization sided with the United States in a dispute over China’s restrictions on American grain imports. (The case was filed by the Obama administration in 2016.) China wasn’t happy with the ruling, but the trade talks drag on. Officials are planning two more rounds of face-to-face meetings at the end of April and beginning of May as they try to reach an agreement. Under the most optimistic circumstances, a presidential signing ceremony could happen as soon as next month. But the talks could also fall apart at any moment. This coming Friday, the Commerce Department will release its first-quarter economic growth data. The Federal Reserve recently lowered its growth estimates for 2019 to 2.1 percent — a full percentage point below the Trump administration’s forecast — and the new report may shed light on who’s got the more accurate picture. Either way, both parties acknowledge that the United States economy is slowing down. And amid concerns of an impending recession, the numbers will either assuage or stoke fears. Soylent, the Silicon Valley-based company that makes drinkable “meals” so that you never have to leave your desk, is expanding into square-shaped chewable food.

The Georgetown researchers published their study on Thursday, after interviewing 40 drivers in the Washington, DC, area over two years. The results aren't meant to be representative of the thousands of ""partners,"" as Uber calls them, working on the platform worldwide. Rather, the study's authors said, ""the data collected and reviewed here is evidence of the structures of work that Uber drivers navigate and the kinds of worker challenges that many face in one of the most visible platform workplaces."" The anecdotes also corroborate stories that multiple drivers across the US have told Business Insider in recent months. Among the litany of frustrations with both the company and the app that drivers expressed in interviews: Half of them take home so little per month — less than $2,000 — that they fall below the government's definition of poverty. ""Since it has been operating in Washington, D.C., Uber has reduced its base rate for drivers several times, added a rider safety fee (and then increased it, calling it a booking fee), and raised the commission it takes from new drivers,"" the study said. ""These changes, which are built into the heart of the Uber platform, seem to have a point: to keep Uber drivers on the road and in the dark."" Uber has options for drivers when the unexpected happens, like a flat tire or a car crash, but even those can sometimes cause more harm than good. The researchers compared the practices to coal-mining ""company towns"" of centuries past. Here's one anecdote from the study, emphasis ours: ""One 48-year old driver, Joan, got caught up in Uber's debt trap after she hit a pothole and damaged her car's suspension system. She spent nearly all the money she had to get the car fixed. Then, when efforts to repair the vehicle failed, she spent more to lease a car from Uber.
""While the Uber Xchange program offered lower credit barriers than traditional lenders, the payments which Uber automatically deducted from drivers' paychecks, were high. It resembled a company town. Joan paid $138, more than the national lease average of $100 per week.
""Before she worked for Uber, Joan would collect giveaway items from Craigslist and re-sell them on eBay or at flea markets. Her regular income of roughly $35,000 as a school bus driver covered her mortgage but not groceries for herself and her son. Joan started driving for Uber a couple nights after work, making for 16-hour days. But within a year Joan quit Uber and returned the car. Even after driving six to seven days per week, she found herself behind on bills.""

Even after driving six to seven days per week, she found herself behind on bills."" Uber took issue with many of the study's findings, pointing to its ""180 Days of Change"" program it launched in June 2017 to combat its damaged reputation in the wake of sexism allegations and the departure of Travis Kalanick, its founder. ""Uber has changed a lot since this research was started. Driver-partners are the heart of our service — and Uber would not be what it is today without them,"" a company representative said in an email. ""Building on what we've already introduced, like in-app tipping, a redesigned driver app, Instant Pay, and new rewards programs like Uber Pro, we'll continue to improve the experience for and with drivers, every day."" The study also found that Uber drivers felt a distinct lack of community. Seventy-five percent ""said that they had never had a drink or meal with anyone else who had ever driven for Uber,"" the study said. ""The lack of physical space in which workers met or congregated creates a material barrier to collective identities and deeply shapes the geography of labor and possibilities for collective bargaining in the platform workplace."" That's pushed many drivers to online forums like UberPeople.net, where they discuss things like pay, best practices, and more. Often, these forums are the only place drivers can talk with others to compare their interactions with the company. Uber has fought to keep drivers classified as independent contractors rather than full-fledged employees, whom it would be required to provide benefits. The company said this month in its filing for an initial public offering that drivers being considered employees instead of contractors could seriously damage its business. ""Our conclusion is straightforward: The patterns identified in this study raise questions about the extent to which working conditions in the ride-hailing industry conform to contemporary labor standards,"" the study said.

According to the Times' Natalie Kitroeff and David Gelles, several current and former employees at Boeing's Dreamliner factory in North Charleston, South Carolina described an over-hurried assembly line struggling to complete aircraft on time, resulting in potentially dangerous shortcuts. The Times reported several instances of debris and tools being left on board Dreamliners coming out of the factory, with possible consequences for the safety of the planes. A former quality manager at the factory described loose metal shavings left over from the assembly process hanging perilously close to the plane's flight control wires, which could damage those controls, according to the report. Read more: Boeing can't deliver the 737 Max to customers, and now the planes are clogging up its storage lots Another technician at the plant told the Times that the amount of debris he found near electrical systems meant that he was unwilling to fly on the Dreamliner owing to the safety issues, a detail highlighted in a tweet from the Times' finance editor David Enrich. ""I never plan to fly on it,"" he reportedly said. Another former Boeing technician described finding other pieces of loose debris on Dreamliner, including ""tubes of sealant, nuts, stuff from the build process,"" according to the Times. The report cites other instances of parts and tools left on planes, including a ladder and a string of lights inside the tail of a plane, which could threaten the plane's control surfaces. Some airlines expressed concerns about Dreamliners from the North Charleston factory as well. According to the report, the CEO of Qatar Airlines sent a video to the factory in 2014, expressing disappointment and concerns about delays and flaws in Dreamliners assembled there. The Times noted that the airline subsequently only purchased Dreamliners assembled in Boeing's Everett, Washington factory. The Times pointed out that, while there were many incidents of loose debris on Dreamliners from the North Charleston factory, the planes continue to have an excellent safety record, and none of the incidents appear to have caused any actual major safety problems.",never plan fly workers reportedly recount poor practices boeing factory south carolina could spell trouble dreamliner plane,wake two tragic crashes led widespread grounding boeing max airplanes new york times reports poor practices south carolina factory could raise questions safety company dreamliner plane well according times natalie kitroeff david gelles several current former employees boeing dreamliner factory north charleston south carolina described assembly line struggling complete aircraft time resulting potentially dangerous shortcuts times reported several instances debris tools left board dreamliners coming factory possible consequences safety planes former quality manager factory described loose metal shavings left assembly process hanging perilously close plane flight control wires could damage controls according report read boeing ca deliver max customers planes clogging storage lots another technician plant told times amount debris found near electrical systems meant unwilling fly dreamliner owing safety issues detail highlighted tweet times finance editor david enrich never plan fly reportedly said another former boeing technician described finding pieces loose debris dreamliner including tubes sealant nuts stuff build process according times report cites instances parts tools left planes including ladder string lights inside tail plane could threaten plane control surfaces airlines expressed concerns dreamliners north charleston factory well according report ceo qatar airlines sent video factory expressing disappointment concerns delays flaws dreamliners assembled times noted airline subsequently purchased dreamliners assembled boeing everett washington factory times pointed many incidents loose debris dreamliners north charleston factory planes continue excellent safety record none incidents appear caused actual major safety problems

By choosing one of the pre-configured cars from the company's existing inventory instead of customizing their own, buyers could immediately (depending on their location) get their hands on one of Tesla's EVs.

A short video of surveillance footage posted on Chinese social media site Weibo (WB) showed white smoke emerging from what looks like a white Tesla car parked at a lot in Shanghai. After a few seconds, the electric vehicle bursts into flames and the clip ends soon afterward. The video, which was filmed just after 8:15 pm local time on April 21, appears to show a Tesla Model S sedan. It was posted on Chinese social media a couple of hours later and has since been shared widely. Tesla (TSLA) would not confirm any of the details, other than to say it is investigating the incident alongside Chinese authorities. ""We immediately sent a team on-site and we're supporting local authorities to establish the facts. From what we know now, no one was harmed,"" a Tesla spokesperson told CNN Business on Monday. The clip attracted a mix of derision and outrage on Weibo. ""Us car owners demand an explanation,"" wrote user Miao Hongyang. ""Jeopardizing our safety in a moment's instant and the fact it ignited so quickly is something we will not tolerate."" Another Weibo user registered under the name Your Dad, added: ""One thing I've learned from this incident: from now on, don't ever park next to a Tesla."" China is huge for Tesla This isn't the first time one of Tesla's cars has appeared to burst into flames, but previous incidents often involved moving vehicles or vehicles that had crashed. ""It seems strange that the battery, not charging, would combust on its own,"" said Tu Le, founder of consultant firm Sino Auto Insights. Tesla has previously said that gasoline-powered cars are 10 times more likely to catch fire than those powered by electric batteries. China is a hugely important market for Tesla. The country accounts for about 20% of the company's annual revenues, or more than $2 billion in sales. But its share of this market is still tiny. The company wants to supercharge sales in China with a new factory in Shanghai. Tesla eventually hopes to produce 500,000 cars at the facility every year. But Tesla is also grappling with a slowdown in the Chinese economy, which has already hit foreign brands including GM (GM) and Ford (F). Import tariffs resulting from the trade war with the United States have seen Tesla prices in China fluctuate wildly. It also has to contend with heavy competition from Chinese players, such as BYD (BYDDF) and NIO (NIO).

Huawei sales: Chinese tech giant Huawei reported Monday that its sales jumped 39% to 179.7 billion yuan ($26.8 billion) in the first quarter. The private company did not reveal its profits, but it did say that its net profit margin had increased slightly to 8%. Huawei sells more telecommunications equipment than any other company in the world, and its smartphone business is growing faster than that of Samsung or Apple (AAPL). But it has come under intense pressure from a US campaign to curb its ambitions to become the global leader of next generation wireless technology, or 5G. Huawei touted its 5G business in its statement on Monday, saying it has signed 40 commercial contracts for 5G with leading global carriers. 2. Iran sanctions: Crude oil futures have spiked after the Washington Post reported that the United States will end sanctions waivers that had allowed some countries to continue buying Iranian oil. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will announce Monday that the United States will no longer grant waivers as of May 2, the newspaper reported. US crude prices increased 2.4% to $66.50 following the report. Brent crude, the international benchmark, advanced 2.7% to $73.90. Both markets are now at their highest level since late 2018. According to the Washington Post, Pompeo is set to announce that countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to make up for lost supply from Iran. 3. Tesla trouble: This is shaping up to be a very big week for Tesla (TSLA). The company is likely to face tough questions from investors and customers after one of its vehicles appeared to explode in China. A short video circulating on social media shows white smoke emerging from what looks like a white Tesla car parked in Shanghai. After a few seconds, the vehicle bursts into flames. ""We immediately sent a team on-site and we're supporting local authorities to establish the facts. From what we know now, no one was harmed,"" a Tesla spokesperson told CNN Business. The electric carmaker will hold its investor day on Monday. It's expected to reveal a major loss on Wednesday when it reports earnings. Tesla said Friday that four directors will leave the company — shrinking the size of its board to seven. One departing board member, Steve Jurvetson, is considered a close ally of CEO Elon Musk. 4.

(Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.) Elon Musk is scheduled to show off Tesla’s latest advances in autonomous vehicles today. (Watch it here at 2 p.m. Eastern.) But it’s unclear whether the event will persuade skeptics that the company is on the right track. Expect to hear a lot about robo-taxis. Mr. Musk has contended that Tesla’s cars would be able to drive without human intervention by next year. Today’s event is expected to promote hardware advances that let the company’s vehicles act as a self-driving fleet. (A Twitter user posted pictures of what was apparently a photo shoot for the event.) Tesla’s exuberance isn’t shared by others in the industry. Ford’s C.E.O., Jim Hackett, said two weeks ago that his company had “overestimated” how quickly the technology had advanced. And Waymo, considered the leader in autonomous vehicles, has rolled out a test robo-taxi program in Phoenix very slowly. The announcement comes before the release of Tesla’s latest quarterly results. The company has already said that it plans to report a loss and disclosed that vehicle sales fell 31 percent from three months ago. Some skeptics think today’s event is a distraction from Wednesday’s earnings report. “I’ve seen this movie before,” David Kudla, a short-seller, told the WSJ. More: Tesla will shrink its board to seven directors from 11 by next year. A federal judge gave the company and the S.E.C. more time to settle their legal dispute. And the carmaker is investigating a report that a Model S exploded in Shanghai. ____________________________ Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York and Michael J. de la Merced in London. ____________________________ The country blocked social networks like Facebook and WhatsApp yesterday after terrorist attacks that killed nearly 300 people. The Sri Lankan government said it had “taken steps to temporarily block all social media avenues until the investigations are concluded.” Residents of Colombo, the capital, told The Guardian that they had received inflammatory unverified information about the attacks before the shutdown. Yet the move also cut off a critical way of communicating, making it harder for Sri Lankans and foreigners to understand what was happening. And the International Federation of Journalists has said that there’s no “substantial” evidence to show such bans can scale down violence, according to the WaPo. The action reflects governments’ wariness of social media. Max Fisher of the NYT writes, “The move suggested not just officials’ worries about social media’s risk to public safety at moments of national tension, but also their distrust in the companies’ ability to manage the platforms responsible.” More: Washington’s reluctance to put limits on social media stands out from the rest of the world. The Chinese telecom giant said that its first-quarter revenue rose 39 percent over the same time a year ago, even as the Trump administration works to block its global growth. Huawei said that its revenue grew to 179.7 billion renminbi, or $26.8 billion, in the first three months of the year. It was the first time that the privately held company has published quarterly results. (The report didn’t include the company’s profit.) It’s all because of 5G. The company said it had signed 40 commercial contracts to supply carriers with the superfast wireless technology, and shipped more than 70,000 5G base stations, the WSJ reports. That’s despite U.S. efforts to persuade allies from using Huawei equipment, calling the company a risk to national security. Australia and Japan have banned Huawei from their wireless infrastructure, but other countries have dismissed the concerns. Huawei is gloating about its success. The company’s founder, Ren Zhengfei, told CNBC, “For such a powerful country to be scared of a small company like us, some other countries are saying, ‘Your products are so good that the U.S. government is scared.’ ” More: The C.I.A. reportedly accused Huawei of being financed by Chinese state security agencies. Critics say the Trump administration is focused too much on bashing Huawei. Japanese prosecutors charged the former Nissan chairman again today, accusing him of breach of trust, a new count of financial impropriety while running the carmaker, Ben Dooley of the NYT reports. It was the fourth indictment for Mr. Ghosn, who was rearrested this month. He had already been accused of falsifying his pay and abusing his office to transfer unrealized trading losses to Nissan. Mr. Ghosn was supposed to be released today — unless he faced new charges. After a raid on his apartment this month, “prosecutors said they were investigating Mr. Ghosn over allegations that he used a Nissan subsidiary to redirect $5 million to himself,” Mr. Dooley reports. Nissan said it had filed a criminal complaint against Mr. Ghosn “after determining that payments made by Nissan to an overseas vehicle sales company via a subsidiary were in fact directed by Ghosn for his personal enrichment.” More: Mr. Ghosn’s wife describes his life behind bars: 30 minutes of fresh air on weekdays, lights on 24 hours a day and no watches. Americans paid much more for washing machines because of tariffs, showing how President Trump’s trade fight has had unintended consequences, Jim Tankersley of the NYT reports. A new report by three economists found: • Consumers bore between 125 percent and 225 percent of the costs of the tariffs. • The price of dryers also went up. • Overall consumer prices rose $1.5 billion. Mr. Trump imposed the tariffs after Whirlpool complained about foreign competitors. The levies started at 20 percent per imported washer and later rose to 50 percent. The president said that the tariffs would create U.S. jobs and falsely claimed that America’s trading partners would foot the bill. American manufacturers ended up increasing their prices after foreign rivals were forced to raise theirs. “The price increases are likely due to domestic firms exploiting their market power,” Felix Tintelnot, one of the report’s authors, told the NYT. And it was an expensive job-creation program: The U.S. gained around 1,800 new jobs because of the tariffs — at a cost of $817,000 each, the report estimates. More trade news: Don’t expect a trade deal to instantly revive investment activity between the U.S. and China. The State Department is reportedly expected to end waivers for nations to buy Iranian oil today. Even as investigators are examining what went wrong with Boeing’s 737 Max jets, company employees have raised concerns about another crucial model for the plane maker, the Dreamliner, Natalie Kitroeff and David Gelles of the NYT report. • With airlines placing hundreds of orders for the Dreamliner, the company set up a factory in South Carolina to help produce the jet along with a plant in Everett, Wash. • But Boeing had no pool of aerospace workers to draw from in South Carolina, and struggled to recruit locally. • Workers have since “filed nearly a dozen whistle-blower claims and safety complaints with federal regulators, describing issues like defective manufacturing, debris left on planes and pressure to not report violations.” • “All factories deal with manufacturing errors, and there is no evidence that the problems in South Carolina have led to any major safety incidents. The Dreamliner has never crashed, although the fleet was briefly grounded after a battery fire. Airlines, too, have confidence in the Dreamliner.” • “I’ve told my wife that I never plan to fly on it,” Joseph Clayton, a technician at the South Carolina factory, told the NYT. “It’s just a safety issue.” The Nobel laureate thinks that the battle over economic priorities has become a war of words — and that it’s time for liberal policies to take on a new image to win over the electorate, Andrew writes. • Mr. Stiglitz, who won the Nobel Prize in economics for identifying the inequities of market economies, now finds that many of his policy proposals have been embraced by the likes of Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. • But as young leftists have embraced the term “socialism,” Republicans have used the term as a political cudgel. • “Some people are trying to attach more emotions to the historical legacy of socialism, which was never the same as communism, but in the United States those distinctions have gotten blurred,” Mr. Stiglitz told Andrew. • Mr. Stiglitz’s preferred term is “progressive capitalism,” because “I believe in a market economy, but I also believe in government regulation.” China reportedly named Chen Siqing as the head of Industrial & Commerce Bank of China, the world’s biggest bank.

The video, time-stamped Sunday evening and widely shared on China's Twitter-like Weibo, shows the parked car emit smoke and burst into flames seconds later. A video purportedly of the aftermath showed a line of three cars completely destroyed. Reuters news agency was not immediately able to verify the origins of the videos, which Weibo users said were taken in Shanghai. The cause of the explosion could not be immediately ascertained from the videos. ""We immediately sent a team on site and we're supporting local authorities to establish the facts. From what we know now, no one was harmed,"" Tesla said in a statement on Monday. Good or bad, negative or positive I will post anything about Tesla or EVs in China. This happened today in Shanghai, China 🇨🇳 1st generation Tesla Model S caught Fire 🔥 underground car park.#Tesla #TeslaChina #ModelS #Fire #China #Shanghai #特斯拉 #中国 $TSLA pic.twitter.com/HOwMcvulV1 It declined to comment further when contacted by Reuters. There have been at least 14 instances of Tesla cars catching fire since 2013, with most occurring after a crash. The automaker has said its cars are about 10 times less likely to experience a fire than petrol-powered cars, based on its fleet of over 500,000 vehicles which have driven billions of kilometres. It did not specify whether the statistic referred to normal use or involved accidents. The latest incident comes as Tesla tries to push sales in China, where its prices were impacted by tit-for-tat tariffs imposed during Sino-US trade tensions last year. The automaker currently imports all the cars it sells in China, but is building a factory in Shanghai that will initially make its Model 3 and help reduce the impact of a trade war. In March, Tesla was also on the receiving end of a labelling mix-up at Shanghai customs that led to a temporary suspension of clearance for a batch of Model 3 cars. Analysts said the latest fire incident would likely increase attention on the safety of electric vehicles, or EVs, but was unlikely to have a significant impact on Tesla's sales or reputation in China while the cause was being investigated. ""Tesla had fire incidents before, but they didn't have a big impact on its reputation in China,"" said analyst Alan Kang at LMC Automotive. ""Since its consumer base is not particularly conservative, and China is pushing the electric vehicle market, if this incident is just accidental, it will not have a big impact on Tesla,"" he said. ""Tesla self-ignites"" was one of the most popular hashtags on Weibo on Monday, racking up over 20 million clicks. Some users urged the automaker to quickly find the cause, whereas others speculated over the impact to the value of Tesla cars currently on the road. Still more found humour in the situation. ""One lesson I learnt from the Shanghai self-exploding Tesla: Don't park your car next to a Tesla,"" said one commentator. In a separate, unrelated incident, Tesla's rival in China, Nio, said in a social media post that an ES8 electric sport utility vehicle caught fire on Monday in a Nio service centre in the central city of Xian while under repair. ""Nio has launched an investigation to determine the cause of the fire,"" Nio said, adding no one was harmed during the incident.",tesla investigates video parked model exploding shanghai,electric car maker tesla says sent team investigate video chinese social media showed parked tesla model car exploding latest string fire incidents involving tesla cars video sunday evening widely shared china weibo shows parked car emit smoke burst flames seconds later video purportedly aftermath showed line three cars completely destroyed reuters news agency immediately able verify origins videos weibo users said taken shanghai cause explosion could immediately ascertained videos immediately sent team site supporting local authorities establish facts know one harmed tesla said statement monday good bad negative positive post anything tesla evs china happened today shanghai china generation tesla model caught fire underground car tesla teslachina models fire china shanghai 特斯拉 中国 tsla declined comment contacted reuters least instances tesla cars catching fire since occurring crash automaker said cars times less likely experience fire cars based fleet vehicles driven billions kilometres specify whether statistic referred normal use involved accidents latest incident comes tesla tries push sales china prices impacted tariffs imposed trade tensions last year automaker currently imports cars sells china building factory shanghai initially make model help reduce impact trade war march tesla also receiving end labelling shanghai customs led temporary suspension clearance batch model cars analysts said latest fire incident would likely increase attention safety electric vehicles evs unlikely significant impact tesla sales reputation china cause investigated tesla fire incidents big impact reputation china said analyst alan kang lmc automotive since consumer base particularly conservative china pushing electric vehicle market incident accidental big impact tesla said tesla one popular hashtags weibo monday racking million clicks users urged automaker quickly find cause whereas others speculated impact value tesla cars currently road still found humour situation one lesson learnt shanghai tesla park car next tesla said one commentator separate unrelated incident tesla rival china nio said social media post electric sport utility vehicle caught fire monday nio service centre central city xian repair nio launched investigation determine cause fire nio said adding one harmed incident

On a highway, the Navigate on Autopilot software feature can take over most of the driving. Available on all properly equipped Teslas, it allows a car to change lanes on its own and even drive through highway interchange ramps itself while the driver's hands just hold the steering wheel. During a recent test drive, though, I was reminded that human intervention can still be needed. A street sweeper drove up onto the highway and crossed three lanes of traffic, nearly clipping the front bumper of a Model 3 I was riding in. The Tesla representative in the driver's seat hit the brakes. Sure, the Tesla Model 3 might have braked on its own in time to avoid a collision, but neither of us wanted to try that experiment. Most of the time, though, the car was largely driving on its own. Our hands were on the steering wheel as we took turns driving back and forth between two locations in New Jersey but, as long as we were on a highway, the car was doing most of the work. The Model 3 wasn't just holding its lane. It was changing lanes and even driving along exit and entrance ramps as we went from one highway to another, all without having to prompt it. The car was following its own navigation route to our destination. I'm used to checking the navigation screen as I approach an exit ramp, trying to judge when I should move over into the slower right lane. If I move over too soon I waste time in slow traffic. If I wait too long I risk missing the exit. With Navigate on Autopilot, the car makes the decisions. Punch in a destination and as soon as you enter a highway — the system only works on highways — the car can begin changing lanes and maneuvering through interchanges to follow that route. You can keep your feet entirely off the pedals. You can take your hands off the steering wheel, too, for brief periods, but the car won't change lanes or go down an exit ramp without your hands on the wheel. There are a number of settings you can choose according to how comfortable you are with letting the car take over. You can require the system to ""ask"" you before changing lanes or, as I did, you can set it to change lanes without prompting you for permission first. You'll still be alerted with steering wheel vibrations, sounds, or both before a lane change happens but the car won't wait for you to OK it. It will wait for an opening in the next lane, of course. The car will even slow down or speed up (up to the maximum speed you've set) to get to an open spot it can safely merge into. Like most humans, Navigate on Autopilot will also change lanes if the one you're in is just moving too slowly. That feature can be disabled or set to various degrees of aggressiveness all the way up to ""Mad Max."" The ""Mad Max"" setting will not fire a rocket to blow up the car in front of you. It will, however, change lanes automatically even if the other lane is going only a little faster. None of this will work in the rain, though. All the features of the older and more familiar Tesla Autopilot system will continue to work in a downpour. You can even request a lane change by using the turn signal stalk and the car will do it. But, in a commendable display of caution, Tesla (TSLA) decided that Navigate on Autopilot will, for now at least, be disabled when there's rain. Water droplets can foul the camera lenses so the car's decision-making capabilities are curtailed. We had to delay our test drive to allow a shower to pass, but after we were all done and I was driving home in a crossover SUV without any of this technology, I found that I missed it. I was back to having to choose lanes and get onto exit ramps myself on boring northern New Jersey interstates. I love driving, but it was great to have the help. I do worry about Navigate on Autopilot, though. More accurately, I worry about putting this sort of technology into the hands of people who will over-trust and abuse it. Yes, there are some disclaimer paragraphs when you enable the system. It looks like the same sort of legal language I routinely ignore when updating my smartphone. As you're approaching the exit ramp off the highway, the system begins alerting you that it will turn off in 600 hundred feet, then 500 feet, etc. Yes, there are steering wheel vibrations and tones, but the actual text warning you of this is pretty small. It seems to me that it should be big and probably flashing. Basically, every warning and disclaimer should be phrased and sized to be clearly seen and understood by the biggest bonehead conceivable. Because it's that bonehead who will fail to understand that this is not a self-driving car. It's a car that helps you drive. I worry that a lot of people will have trouble keeping that straight.

There are many reasons to worry about Tesla, including more competition, lower U.S. tax credits and an ""aging"" product lineup, wrote Evercore analyst Arndt Ellinghorst, who expects these headwinds to weigh on demand and cause a 40% decline in earnings per share by 2020. Evercore also slashed its 12-month price target for Tesla to $240 per share from $330, implying 12% downside from Friday's close. Shares of Tesla are down more than 3% to $264 on Monday. ""The change in recommendation and lower [price target] are driven by a more cautious view on demand across all Models, but in particular the recent severe decline in demand for Model S/X,"" Ellinghorst said in a note to clients. ""There is increased uncertainty around near-term demand vs previous bullish forecasts and growth cannot stall for a growth company."" Shares of Tesla have fallen nearly 18% year to date amid dozens of investigations and lawsuits against the company and CEO Elon Musk. On top of the legal woes, the electric car maker's production keeps disappointing investors. The company reported weaker-than-expected delivery numbers for the first quarter overall and for its key product Model 3 midsize sedan. Demand for Tesla electric vehicles is also challenged by the revised tax incentives. The credit for Tesla buyers was halved to $3,750 beginning Jan. 1. Tesla had slashed prices by $2,000 on all models to offset the tax credit reduction. ""The market used to be concerned about production, we're now concerned about demand,"" Ellinghorst said. ""Without properly refreshing the models, the growth story for Model S/X appears to be over."" Tesla's stock would trade more favorably if the company raised $2 billion to $3 billion in equity, the analyst said.

In the 23-second clip, the Tesla car self-ignites and emits white smoke just before exploding in a parking lot beside other cars.

The explosion occurred Sunday evening in the basement parking garage of an apartment complex in Shanghai’s Xuhui District, according to a post by the local fire department on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. Security camera footage accompanying the post showed smoke creeping from beneath a parked Tesla sedan for a few seconds before the car bursts into flames. Two other cars were also damaged, the fire department said. “Last night we dispatched a team at once to the scene,” Tesla said in a Monday morning post on its Weibo account. The fire department said the cause of the explosion was still being investigated. This is not the first fire in a Tesla, which uses lithium-ion batteries that can combust if they are damaged or subjected to high temperatures in what is known as “thermal runaway.” Just last week, a parked Tesla caught fire at a service center near Pittsburgh. The same car had previously caught fire in February, according to a local news report. Officials have not established the cause of that fire. To avoid catastrophic battery fires on planes, the Federal Aviation Administration has prohibited the transportation of spare lithium batteries in checked baggage. China is a surging market for electric vehicles, and Tesla has many fans here. In January, the company started construction on a huge new factory near Shanghai, its first plant outside the United States. The trade war between the United States and China has directly affected Tesla’s business. After President Trump issued his first tariffs last year on $50 billion in Chinese-made goods, Beijing retaliated by increasing tariffs on American-made cars to 40 percent.

The EV maker has obtained a temporary restraining order against Randeep Hothi after accusing the man of routinely threatening its staff. He reportedly injured a security guard at Tesla's Fremont factory with his car in February after he was asked to leave the parking lot, and on April 16th stalked a Tesla-owned Model 3 for 35 minutes on the freeway to the point where he forced the car into a automatic emergency maneuver to avoid a collision. Randeep and his brother Gagan (who works for VW) allegedly also run a Twitter account that frequently blasts Musk and Tesla, proclaiming the company's doom. Previously, users also linked the Hothi brothers to Reddit accounts that moderated a Tesla stock subreddit. Hothi hasn't addressed the restraining order so far, although a hearing on Tesla's request for a longer-lasting order is scheduled for May 7th. Musk, not surprisingly, isn't happy. In a response to a Twitter follower who'd learned about the restraining order, the CEO said he'd ""never seen anything like it"" and was baffled that investors like Hothi would want the company to fail. This isn't the first time Tesla has grappled with individuals who allegedly pose threats to the company. It accused a former factory worker of conducting ""sabotage"" by leaking harmful information to the media, and even said an oil industry exec impersonated him to get sensitive data. Those earlier examples weren't investors, though, and they certainly didn't put Tesla employees in physical danger. If the claims are accurate, it's an escalation that would give Tesla good reason to worry. Never seen anything like it.

Global carmakers, large technology companies and an array of startups are developing self-driving – including Alphabet Inc’s Waymo and Uber Technologies Inc – but experts say it will be years before the systems are ready for deployment. Musk previously forecast that by 2018 cars would go “from your driveway to work without you touching anything.” Teslas still require human intervention and are not considered fully self-driving, according to industry standards. The webcast, delayed by about 30 minutes, began with the head of AutoPilot, Pete Bannon, giving a highly technical description of its newly designed chip for self-driving, which Tesla has been developing since 2016. Musk, who sat on the stage next to Bannon, interrupted once to add: “Any part of this could fail and the car will keep driving.” Musk said that Tesla had designed the best self-driving chip in the world, despite the improbability of a company new to chip-building having done so. “All cars being produced right now have this computer,” said Musk. “All Tesla cars being produced right now have everything necessary for full self-driving. All you have to do is improve the software.”
Shares did not move during the presentation and remained down 3.5 per cent at US$263.58. Teslas have been involved in a handful of crashes, some of them fatal, involving the use of the company’s AutoPilot system. The system has automatic steering and cruise control but requires driver attention at the wheel. Tesla has been criticized by safety groups for being unclear about the need for “hands-on” driving. The company also sells a “full self-driving option” for an additional $5,000, explained on Tesla’s website as “automatic driving from highway on-ramp to off-ramp,” automatic lane changes, the ability to autopark and to summon a parked car. Coming later in 2019 is the ability to recognize traffic lights and stop signs, and perform automatic driving on city streets, Tesla says. But Tesla’s use of the term “full self-driving” still garners criticism, as the option is not yet “Level 4,” or fully autonomous by industry standards, in which the car can handle all aspects of driving in most circumstances with no human intervention. Tesla says its cars have the necessary hardware for full self-driving in most circumstances, and Musk said in February he was certain that Tesla would be “feature complete” for full self-driving in 2019, although drivers would still need to pay attention until the system’s reliability improved. Tesla reports first-quarter earnings on Wednesday.

The vision sketched out Monday during an event at Tesla’s Silicon Valley headquarters requires several leaps of faith — something that the zealous investors and consumers who view Musk as a technological genius often are willing to take. But self-driving car experts fear Musk is shirking public safety in an effort to boost Tesla’s stock and sell more of the company’s electric cars. This amid lingering questions about whether the 15-year-old automaker can consistently make money. “It sounds like a pipe dream that he’s selling people,” said Raj Rajkumar, an electrical and computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University. “I think it’s basically overpromising, which is typical of Elon Musk.” To prove his skeptics wrong, Musk will have to persuade regulators that Tesla’s technology for transforming potentially hundreds of thousands of electric cars into self-driving vehicles will produce robots that are safer and more reliable than humans. And to do that, Musk will have to be correct in his bet that Tesla has come up with a better way to produce self-driving cars than virtually every other of the more than 60 companies in the U.S. working toward the same goal. Some of those companies are aiming to have their fully autonomous cars begin carrying passengers in small geographic areas as early as this year, but many experts don’t believe they’ll be in widespread use for a decade or more. Unlike most of those other companies, Tesla’s cars won’t come with the light beam sensors called Lidar that many industry experts consider to be essential equipment for robotic vehicles to navigate the road. Musk trashed Lidar as a “fool’s errand” and “frigging stupid” in a putdown of companies such as Google spin-off Waymo and General Motors’ Cruise Automation that are including the light beam sensors in their systems. “They are going to dump Lidar,” Musk assured investors and analysts gathered at Tesla’s Palo Alto, California, office for the 2 ½ hour presentation. Musk, widely known for his swagger as much as his smarts, spent much of the time trying to persuade both the investors and consumers that he had figured out a better way to teach robots how to drive. “It is fundamentally insane to buy anything other than a Tesla,” Musk said at one point, arguing that purchasing a vehicle from any other automaker would be like getting a horse. Musk’s quasi-sales pitch came two days before Tesla is expected to report a disappointing performance for the first three months of the year. Analysts polled by FactSet predict a $305.5 million first quarter net loss based on disappointing car sales, a setback after Musk pledged heading into the second half of last year that Tesla would be profitable from that point onward. Tesla’s stock sank by nearly 4 percent to close Monday at $262.75. From Musk’s vantage point, Tesla has a huge advantage over autonomous vehicle competitors because it gathers a massive amount of data in the real world. This quarter, he said Tesla will have 500,000 vehicles on the road, each equipped with eight cameras, ultrasonic sensors and radar gathering data to help build the company’s neural network, which will serve as the digital equivalent of the self-driving cars’ consciousness. The network allows vehicles to recognize images, determine what objects are and figure out how to deal with them. To become fully self-driving, the cars also need a special computer that fits behind the glove box and is powered by a special chip Musk boasted is better than any other processor in the world “by a huge margin.” Currently the self-driving computer costs $5,000, but the price rises to $7,000 if it’s installed after delivery. Finally, Tesla will deliver software updates to those computers to make it possible for its electric cars to be driven by a robot, without a human in position to take over in case something goes awry. There will be a slight chance of some “fender benders,” Musk acknowledged Monday, and indicated Tesla will be liable for accident caused by a vehicle under the control of its robot. “People will die,” Rajkumar predicted. “I can tell you that right now. Because in the real world, crazy things happen.” Musk predicted that the technology for fully self-driving Tesla will roll out at some point from April to June next year. Then, Tesla will need to get regulatory approval for the fully autonomous cars to drive on roads, something Musk predicted would happen in a few states by the end of next year. He didn’t specific where Tesla will try to gain approval first. California, Tesla’s biggest U.S. market, requires proof that fully autonomous cars can drive safely on public roads, but most other states aren’t as stringent. And experts say there’s no federal law requiring preapproval for fully autonomous driving, as long as a vehicle meets federal safety standards, which Teslas already do. Within three years, Tesla will be manufacturing self-driving cars that don’t even have steering wheels or brake pedals in them, Musk said. If they’re allowed on the roads, fully driverless cars would allow Musk to carry out his plan to expand into the ride-hailing market with a fleet of sleek Teslas. Owners of Teslas with the company’s self-driving computer could plug into an app-based network to pick up fare-paying passengers when they didn’t need to use their vehicle. Musk theorizes that a ride-hailing service similar to Uber and Lyft will boost Tesla’s revenue and make it easier for the company to sell its cars to consumers who could effectively lower the cost of ownership by making money on the side. Tesla would get 20% to 25% of each fare in the network. Tesla also intends to convert all the electric cars under leasing contracts to be turned into robotaxis upon their return. Uber and Lyft also consider driverless cars to be one of the keys to making money from their still unprofitable services, but haven’t set a specific timetable for achieving that breakthrough while they continue to work on their own autonomous technology. Waymo rolled out a ride-hailing service using self-driving vehicles late last year in the Phoenix area, but it only available to a small pool of passengers who were previously enrolled in a test program. And all the cars in Waymo’s ride-hailing service still have a human behind the steering wheel ready to take control. The Waymo cars also have Lidar, something experts remain convinced must be part of any fully self-driving car, despite Musk’s colorful contentions otherwise. “Vehicles that don’t have Lidar, that don’t have advanced radar, that haven’t captured a 3-D map are not self-driving vehicles,” Ken Washington, Ford’s chief technical officer, said during a recent interview with Recode. “They are great consumer vehicles with really good driver-assist technology.” ___ Krisher reported from Detroit.",tesla gears fully cars amid skepticism,san francisco ap tesla ceo elon musk expects start converting

Wall Street and the widespread world of freelance Tesla analysts have speculated that CEO Elon Musk is simply offering a new storyline ahead of what Tesla has already conceded could be disappointing first-quarter earnings, which will be reported later this week. (Tesla posted consecutive profitable quarters to finish out 2018.) Tesla stock is down about 14% year to date, so investors are already pricing in the disappointment. They also appear to be unexcited about the robo-taxi event. And it bears repeating that a Tesla share slide at the beginning of a calendar year is old news — Tesla used to decline pretty reliably for the first half before recovering to end a year. So if Tesla can't move the stock with Tesla Network news, why host an event? It's simple: The company is paying attention. Read more: Extreme opinions about Tesla are completely wrong — here's why Cruise, General Motors' standalone effort, is now worth almost $15 billion based on investments from Japan's SoftBank and Honda. Toyota, Denso, and SoftBank recently put $1 billion into Uber's autonomous efforts, making the pre-IPO subset of the ride-hailing service worth $7 billion. Tesla also struck a deal last week with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to enable the company to dodge emission penalties in Europe: The legacy company will pay Tesla hundreds of millions of euros to include Tesla vehicles in its overall fleet. (If that sounds sketchy, it isn't — Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is effectively just buying Tesla's European regulatory equity in the same way some automakers in the US purchase the zero-emission-vehicle credits that Tesla racks up by selling only electric cars.) Musk before introducing the Model Y at Tesla's design studio.
AP Photo/Jae C. Hong For Tesla, the problem to be solved here is with its balance sheet: The company is going to spend itself down to about $1 billion in cash on hand this year, and it needs to either tap the public markets to raise capital as it has in the past or find some new funding sources (or both). Musk has seen what Cruise, Uber, and Waymo (owned by Alphabet) have pulled off and, being savvy about bringing in money, doesn't see why Tesla shouldn't get its slice of the pie. The main reason why is that Tesla has a lot more vehicles on the road — equipped with its Autopilot technology that's gathering data — than the theoretical competition. Commercialized autonomous ride-hailing is a limited business. Tesla is also using a visual system instead of the laser radars that much of the new industry now favors. Tesla's argument is that the ""lidar"" setups can't operate in a wide variety of conditions (such as snow and fog), whereas Tesla's system is akin to a human driver but with superior eyes (and more of them) and a much, much bigger and faster brain. So ultimately this is really a transparent follow-the-money pitch from Tesla.

Video on the Chinese social-networking platform Weibo that first surfaced Sunday evening appears to show the car emitting smoke before erupting into flames, igniting several other cars in the area. Business Insider was not able to verify the videos, which were first reported by the local blog Shanghaiist. Shanghai's fire department said on Weibo that it dispatched 15 fire engines to the scene, where it took just under an hour to extinguish the blaze. Authorities confirmed that the fire spread to an Audi and a Lexus parked nearby.  In response, Tesla's official Weibo account said it the company was aware of the incident and was investigating the cause. Here's its comment, translated by Business Insider: ""After learning about the accident in Shanghai, we dispatched our team to the scene last night. We are in active communication with the relevant departments and coordinating for the situation as appropriate. According to currently available information, there are no casualties."" Tesla did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. In an interview with China's Xinmin Evening News, the car's owner said the 2015 Model S was not charging at the time of the fire but had been charged a few hours prior. While Tesla sells some of the safest cars on the roads, its batteries can be particularly tricky for firefighters. Last week, another Model S caught fire shortly after being towed to a repair shop in Pennsylvania, despite word from Tesla that the battery had been disconnected and would not catch fire. According to Reuters, there have been at least 14 instances of Tesla vehicles igniting in the past six years, most of which have occurred after a crash. Battery fires can burn hotter and longer than those of Tesla's gasoline-powered counterparts. Tesla's own documentation for first responders says a fire in the Model S can take up to 3,000 gallons of water to establish sufficient cooling for the battery.

Tesla Model S battery bursts into flames, car “totally destroyed” in 5 minutes
Electric vehicles should in theory be no less safe than gasoline powered vehicles, which often drive around carrying gallons of highly flammable liquid hydrocarbons on board. (Indeed, I've seen more than one parked car on fire in Washington, DC over the past few years, none of which were electric cars.) While EV fires are rare, when batteries do ignite, the fire can be difficult to extinguish and the battery can often reignite in the following hours or days. That happened to the Rimac hypercar that The Grand Tour's Richard Hammond crashed, and it was also the case with a damaged Tesla in Pittsburgh earlier this month.",tesla yet know model burst flames shanghai,tesla sending investigative team shanghai parking garage see determine caused model electric vehicle explode flames weekend news car spontaneous combustion spread social media complete cctv footage parking garage wisps smoke began emerge underneath model exploded flame good bad negative positive post anything tesla evs china happened today shanghai china generation tesla model caught fire underground car tesla teslachina models fire china shanghai 特斯拉 中国 tsla jay shanghai shanghaijayin april according local fire department weibo account two cars also damaged fire tesla also used weibo make statement acknowledging fire participation investigation learning accident occurred shanghai sent team scene last night tesla wrote according google translation actively contacting relevant departments supporting verification according current information casualties reading tesla model battery bursts flames car totally destroyed minutes electric vehicles theory less safe gasoline powered vehicles often drive around carrying gallons highly flammable liquid hydrocarbons board indeed seen one parked car fire washington dc past years none electric cars ev fires rare batteries ignite fire difficult extinguish battery often reignite following hours days happened rimac hypercar grand tour richard hammond crashed also case damaged tesla pittsburgh earlier month

""Tesla is making significant progress in the development of its autonomous driving software and hardware, including our FSD computer, which is currently in production and which will enable full-self driving via future over-the-air software updates,"" the company said when it announced the event. Attendees were given red, Tesla-branded badges with sequential numbers, assumably for test rides of the full self-driving functionality.  Musk took the stage just before noon alongside Pete Bannon, the vice president of Autopilot engineering, as more than 40,000 people watched remotely via the company's live YouTube stream. Bannon explained how Tesla designed a new chip for its Autopilot software, noting that the company was able to leverage expertise from multiple teams across the business. ""I really love it when a solution is boiled down to its base elements,"" Bannon said, referring to the chip architecture. ""You have video, computing, and power. It's straightforward and simple."" At the core of all of this is safety, Musk added. ""Any part of this could fail and the car will keep driving,"" Musk said. ""The probability of this computer failing is substantially lower than someone losing consciousness."" The computer is able to authenticate that any code it runs has been authenticated by Tesla as genuine, Bannon said. Neural network accelerators on Tesla's new chip can process 2100 frames per second of incoming imagery from a cars eight constantly running cameras, Bannon said. That's the equivalent of 2.5 billion pixels per second. Tesla ""This is far more detailed than most people would appreciate,"" Musk said after Bannon finished his presentation. ""At first it seems improbable. How could it be that Tesla, who has never designed a chip before, would design the best chip in the world? But that is objectively what has occurred."" But that statement was met with pushback from one competing chip company that Bannon and Musk specifically talked about on stage: Nvidia. A slide during Tesla's presentation compared the processing capabilities of Tesla's chip compared to Nvidia's Drive Xavier chip, saying that Tesla's chip was capable of 144 TOPS of processing vs. the Drive Xavier's 21 TOPS of processing. But Nvidia says there's two issues with this comparison: First, it says its Drive Xavier chip is actually capable of 30 TOPs of processing, not 21. But more importantly, Nvidia says a better comparison would be Tesla's full self-driving computer chip vs. Nvidia's Drive AGX Pegasus, which it says is capable of 320 TOPS of processing. ""Tesla was inaccurate in comparing its Full Self Driving computer at 144 TOPS of processing with Nvidia Drive Xavier at 21 TOPS,"" Nvidia told MarketWatch in a statement. ""The correct comparison would have been against Nvidia's full self-driving computer, Nvidia Drive AGX Pegasus, which delivers 320 TOPS for AI perception, localization and path planning.""",tesla kicked special event show tech tsla,tesla autonomy day kicked monday morning maker headquarters palo alto california executives including ceo elon musk expected give investors details company technology known autopilot tesla making significant progress development autonomous driving software hardware including fsd computer currently production enable driving via future software updates company said announced event attendees given red badges sequential numbers assumably test rides full functionality musk took stage noon alongside pete bannon vice president autopilot engineering people watched remotely via company live youtube stream bannon explained tesla designed new chip autopilot software noting company able leverage expertise multiple teams across business really love solution boiled base elements bannon said referring chip architecture video computing power straightforward simple core safety musk added part could fail car keep driving musk said probability computer failing substantially lower someone losing consciousness computer able authenticate code runs authenticated tesla genuine bannon said neural network accelerators tesla new chip process frames per second incoming imagery cars eight constantly running cameras bannon said equivalent billion pixels per second tesla far detailed people would appreciate musk said bannon finished presentation first seems improbable could tesla never designed chip would design best chip world objectively occurred statement met pushback one competing chip company bannon musk specifically talked stage nvidia slide tesla presentation compared processing capabilities tesla chip compared nvidia drive xavier chip saying tesla chip capable tops processing drive xavier tops processing nvidia says two issues comparison first says drive xavier chip actually capable tops processing importantly nvidia says better comparison would tesla full computer chip nvidia drive agx pegasus says capable tops processing tesla inaccurate comparing full self driving computer tops processing nvidia drive xavier tops nvidia told marketwatch statement correct comparison would nvidia full computer nvidia drive agx pegasus delivers tops ai perception localization path planning

He laid out a vision in which current and future Tesla owners can use their cars for their everyday commutes and then make money from them by watching them drive themselves off for fleet robotaxi service for a few hours. Musk said Tesla will use its own fleet of cars, including Model 3 cars coming off lease, to fill in the service gaps. The aggressive timetable, backed by the advancements that Tesla said it has made, not only puts pressure on Waymo, the Google-developed company considered a leader in driverless cars, but ridesharing giants Uber and Lyft. Musk's comments on the Tesla Autonomy Investor Day came at a critical time. Deliveries of its vehicles came in at 63,000 for the first quarter, well below analysts' consensus expectations of 77,100, which was seen by some as a trouble sign for the company's future. Retire early: Can ordinary Americans find financial independence and stop work by 50? Galaxy delay: Samsung delays launch of Fold following display issues By revealing a future for the company linked not only to vehicle sales but driverless taxis, Musk pointed heavily to a new revenue stream that might boost Tesla's fortunes. But he did not lay out a financial path to achieve it, including whether the company might need to seek additional debt financing. Tesla will keep a share of the revenue when owners give up their cars for a few hours for driverless ridesharing duty – potentially cutting deeply into their price. He also said Teslas, including the battery pack, will be built for 1 million miles of service, including redundant systems for extra safety. ""I feel very confident predicting autonomous robotaxis for Tesla next year,"" Musk said, although he acknowledged the automaker has not lined up any communities yet where they can be tested. Musk said the goal is to have 1 million vehicles, both those in the hands of owners and its own, that could be pressed into the robotaxi service by the end of next year.  However, he added some of his projected timelines have been wrong in the past. Tesla already has one big self-driving advantage over other automakers: The hardware needed to achieve it is already being installed into Tesla vehicles. It started with the Model S and X a month ago and the Model 3 about a week ago, Musk said. He added the only issue stopping the cars from hitting the road in self-driving mode is the software – and it's well on its way to being ready. ""All Tesla cars being produced right now have everything necessary for full self-driving. All you have to do is improve the software,"" he said. He said he's talking about the highest level of self-driving capability – Level 5 – and vehicles that aren't ""geo-fenced,"" meaning electronically confined to a certain area The self-driving system is based around new computer chips that were developed in -house, replacing ones from Nvidia, a tech company that has tried to position itself as a leader in the race to develop self-driving cars. Musk said Tesla has an advantage in that it designed its chip for the single purpose of self-driving. He said the chip will continue to be improved with the next generation due in about two years. The new system was designed to be retrofitted into post-2016 Teslas for owners who want them. The Tesla self-driving system will rely on eight cameras positioned around the car. Unlike other automakers, Tesla will not use so-called Lidar sensors as well, which measure distance in a different way than radar. ""Anyone who relies on Lidar is doomed,"" Musk said. ""They are expensive sensors that are unnecessary."" The auto industry has been scrambling to develop cars that safely pilot themselves. Most have been chasing Waymo, which was among the first to develop the technology. Waymo is an offshoot of Google. Tesla already has a partial self-driving system it calls Autopilot. But the company has underscored that drivers have to always be ready to react rather than let the system do all the driving. Now the car will do all the driving. ""If you don't have a car with hardware necessary for full self-driving, it's like buying a horse,"" he said.

The full self-driving vehicles would compete with ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft. Musk pitched the robo-taxis as a way for Tesla owners to make money when they aren't using their vehicles. Tesla's program would let a Tesla owner rent out their vehicle for rides, with Tesla taking a cut of the revenue and the rest of the money going to the vehicle's owner. ""It's financially insane to buy anything other than a Tesla,"" Musk said. ""It'll be like owning a horse in three years."" Tesla forecasted the robo-taxis would last 11 years, drive 1 million miles and make $30,000 gross profit per car annually. It's another aggressive prediction from Musk about Tesla's technology. His company has missed a previous self-imposed deadline for having an autonomous Tesla drive across the country. Musk also said he expects to convince regulators by the end of next year that self-driving Teslas are sufficiently safer than a human driver. Musk also acknowledged his pattern of missing deadlines. ""The only criticism and it's a fair one, sometimes I'm not on time. But I get it done and the Tesla team gets it done,"" Musk said.

They don’t always come true. On Monday, Mr. Musk said the company was on the cusp of making cars that could drive themselves safely on any road. He also promised that the company would begin operating a fleet of driverless “robo taxis” by the end of next year. “I’m very convinced,” Mr. Musk said in a presentation to analysts at the company’s headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif. “In the future, people will want to outlaw people driving their own cars because they’ll be unsafe” compared with autonomous vehicles. Many auto executives and analysts think Mr. Musk is being wildly optimistic and say cars that can drive themselves at all times are at least several years away. “The idea that you can have a vehicle that can make complex decisions for full self-driving is just not plausible at this point,” said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst. If Mr. Ramsey is correct, it wouldn’t be the first time Mr. Musk has gotten ahead of himself. The chief executive once forecast that Tesla would make 500,000 cars in 2018, but it produced half that many. Last summer, he said Tesla would make 10,000 Model 3 sedans a week — about twice the number currently coming off the assembly line. Mr. Musk had also promised a Model 3 for $35,000, which spurred tens of thousands of people to put down $1,000 deposits long before production had started. Tesla recently began making that car, but customers can order it only on the telephone or by visiting a store, not online, the way most customers prefer to buy its cars. In the presentation on Monday, Mr. Musk and other executives described the technologies that the company is developing to allow cars to drive themselves, building on the Autopilot system that it has offered for several years. He said Tesla had developed “the world’s fastest computer” for use in self-driving cars, able to conduct 144 trillion operations per second. Nvidia, a leading maker of chips for automotive use and a former supplier to Tesla, disputed that claim, saying it had a computer that can run 320 trillion operations per second. Mr. Musk also said Tesla is developing “neural networks” of computers that can mimic the human brain and will enable driverless cars to operate safely using only cameras and radar sensors. Most other automakers are relying on cameras, radar and a type of laser-based radar known as lidar. Other car companies have recently acknowledged that the development of self-driving technology is going to take longer than they had previously thought. “We overestimated the arrival of autonomous vehicles,” Jim Hackett, Ford Motor’s chief executive, said this month in Detroit. Mr. Musk’s lofty prognostications about self-driving cars and the new business of robo-taxis came as investors are bracing for troubling news from the electric carmaker. On Wednesday, Tesla is expected to report a loss for the first quarter amid slumping sales. The company previously said it delivered 63,000 cars in the quarter, down 31 percent from the fourth quarter, despite beginning sales of its Model 3 sedan in Europe and China. Wall Street analysts are also concerned that Tesla does not have enough cash on hand. It ended 2018 with $3.7 billion, but used nearly $1 billion for a payment to bondholders in March. It recently said its cash reserve was “sufficient.” Tesla stock closed down nearly 4 percent on Monday, suggesting that many investors were skeptical about Mr. Musk’s predictions about self-driving cars. Investors were also spooked earlier in the day when Tesla said it was sending engineers to China to investigate why one of its cars appeared to spontaneously combust while parked in a Shanghai garage. Electric vehicles are powered by lithium-ion batteries that can burn if they are damaged or subjected to high temperatures in what is know as “thermal runaway.” Just last week, a parked Tesla caught fire at a service center near Pittsburgh. The car had previously caught fire in February, according to a local news report. In February, a man was killed in Florida when the Tesla he was driving crashed and was engulfed in flames. Tesla introduced Autopilot in October 2015. It scans the road for obstacles and other vehicles, and can brake, accelerate and even pass other vehicles with little input from the driver. It tracks lines on highways to stay within lanes. Yet it has come under scrutiny in at least four fatal crashes. In 2016, an Ohio man was killed when his Model S crashed into a tractor-trailer crossing a highway in Florida. Autopilot failed to recognize the truck and neither it nor the driver applied the brakes. While one federal safety agency found no technological defect in Autopilot, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the system “played a major role” in the crash. Another accident in which a Tesla collided with a tractor-trailer occurred in Florida earlier this year. In 2018, a California man was killed when his Tesla Model X crashed into a concrete barrier on a highway. And in 2016 in China, a Model S ran into a street sweeper, killing the Tesla’s driver. Despite Mr. Musk’s proclamations about Autopilot’s capabilities, owners’ manuals warn Tesla drivers that the system “cannot detect all objects and may not brake/decelerate for stationary vehicles, especially in situations when you are driving over 50 m.p.h.” In-car warnings also remind drivers that despite its name, Autopilot is only a driver-assistance system and is not intended to pilot cars on its own. While Tesla is developing self-driving systems that use only cameras and radar to scan roads and identify obstacles, other companies, including Waymo, the autonomous-car division of Google’s parent company, also use lidar. Mr. Musk dismissed lidar as “friggin’ stupid” on Monday. Randy Reibel, chief executive of Blackmore, a maker of lidar systems for cars, disagreed. “With radar you can see something on the road, but you can’t tell how big it is,” Mr. Reibel said. “Cameras can tell you what something is, but not how far away it is. With lidar, you can see an apple or a brick on the road and know it’s an apple or a brick.” Even lidar is not foolproof. In 2018, a self-driving, lidar-equipped vehicle being tested by Uber hit and killed a pedestrian crossing a road at night in Tempe, Ariz.",elon musk predicts tesla driverless taxi fleet next year,elon musk tesla chief executive made plenty bold predictions always come true monday musk said company cusp making cars could drive safely road also promised company would begin operating fleet driverless robo taxis end next year convinced musk said presentation analysts company headquarters palo alto future people want outlaw people driving cars unsafe compared autonomous vehicles many auto executives analysts think musk wildly optimistic say cars drive times least several years away idea vehicle make complex decisions full plausible point said mike ramsey gartner analyst ramsey correct first time musk gotten ahead chief executive forecast tesla would make cars produced half many last summer said tesla would make model sedans week twice number currently coming assembly line musk also promised model spurred tens thousands people put deposits long production started tesla recently began making car customers order telephone visiting store online way customers prefer buy cars presentation monday musk executives described technologies company developing allow cars drive building autopilot system offered several years said tesla developed world fastest computer use cars able conduct trillion operations per second nvidia leading maker chips automotive use former supplier tesla disputed claim saying computer run trillion operations per second musk also said tesla developing neural networks computers mimic human brain enable driverless cars operate safely using cameras radar sensors automakers relying cameras radar type radar known lidar car companies recently acknowledged development technology going take longer previously thought overestimated arrival autonomous vehicles jim hackett ford motor chief executive said month detroit musk lofty prognostications cars new business came investors bracing troubling news electric carmaker wednesday tesla expected report loss first quarter amid slumping sales company previously said delivered cars quarter percent fourth quarter despite beginning sales model sedan europe china wall street analysts also concerned tesla enough cash hand ended billion used nearly billion payment bondholders march recently said cash reserve tesla stock closed nearly percent monday suggesting many investors skeptical musk predictions cars investors also spooked earlier day tesla said sending engineers china investigate one cars appeared spontaneously combust parked shanghai garage electric vehicles powered batteries burn damaged subjected high temperatures know thermal last week parked tesla caught fire service center near pittsburgh car previously caught fire february according local news report february man killed florida tesla driving crashed engulfed flames tesla introduced autopilot october scans road obstacles vehicles brake accelerate even pass vehicles little input driver tracks lines highways stay within lanes yet come scrutiny least four fatal crashes ohio man killed model crashed crossing highway florida autopilot failed recognize truck neither driver applied brakes one federal safety agency found technological defect autopilot national transportation safety board concluded system played major role crash another accident tesla collided occurred florida earlier year california man killed tesla model x crashed concrete barrier highway china model ran street sweeper killing tesla driver despite musk proclamations autopilot capabilities owners manuals warn tesla drivers system detect objects may stationary vehicles especially situations driving warnings also remind drivers despite name autopilot system intended pilot cars tesla developing systems use cameras radar scan roads identify obstacles companies including waymo division google parent company also use lidar musk dismissed lidar friggin stupid monday randy reibel chief executive blackmore maker lidar systems cars disagreed radar see something road tell big reibel said cameras tell something far away lidar see apple brick road know apple even lidar foolproof vehicle tested uber hit killed pedestrian crossing road night tempe ariz

""The fundamental message that consumers should be taking today, it is financially insane to buy anything other than a Tesla. It will be like owning a horse in three years. I mean, fine if you want to own a horse. But you should go into it with that expectation,"" the Tesla CEO said on Monday. ""Like, people should really think about their purchase ... it's basically crazy to buy any other car but a Tesla. We need to convey that argument clearly, and we will after today,"" Musk said. The reason you would be ""crazy"" to buy a rival's car, according to Musk, is because Tesla has equipped its cars with the hardware necessary to become fully self-driving. ""If you buy a car that does not have the hardware for full self-driving, it is like buying a horse. And the only car that has the hardware for full self-driving is a Tesla,"" Musk said.

That custom chip, built by Samsung, is expected to move the electric-car company further on the path toward truly autonomous driving, known as Level 4 autonomy. ""All you need to do is improve the software,"" Musk said. But the company isn't quite there yet. A test vehicle from Argo AI, Ford's autonomous vehicle unit.
AP Photo/Keith Srakocic Musk has received some criticism from scholars and industry experts who take exception to Musk's use of the phrase ""full self-driving"" when describing the technology Tesla is selling. In an interview with The Associated Press, Raj Rajkumar, who teaches electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, said ""It sounds like a pipe dream that he's selling people. I think it's basically overpromising, which is typical of Elon Musk."" In exact terms, Level 4 autonomy means a vehicle ""will not require you to take over while driving,"" the Society of Automotive Engineers says. Additionally, at Level 4, a traditional steering wheel and pedals become optional. Dozens of companies, including many automakers, are developing advanced driver-assist technologies with an eye toward autonomous driving. Read more: Tesla's biggest challenge with full-self-driving technology is obvious Tesla's Autopilot feature and the extra-cost ""full-self-driving"" option can accelerate, brake, and steer the vehicle. The latter adds the Summon feature, automatic lane changes, and ""Navigate on Autopilot,"" which can guide Tesla vehicles to a preset destination from on-ramp to off-ramp and merge onto freeway interchanges. Both of these systems still require a human to be present and alert in the driver's seat, ready to immediately take control of the car when necessary. Musk said ""probably two years from now, we'll make a car with no steering wheel or pedals,"" implying Tesla could achieve Level 4 autonomy, or true self-driving capability, within that timeframe — but he acknowledged he has often touted aggressive benchmarks that Tesla did not meet. The company has previously said its self-driving tech would be ready for a cross-country road trip by the end of 2017. Matthew DeBord/BI Marketing self-driving capabilities has tremendous safety implications as well, according to Consumer Reports' advocacy group. The organization said public perceptions of what current driver-assist technologies can do are shaped in part by how automakers talk about those systems. ""Today's driver-assistance technologies have helped deliver on safety, but the marketplace is full of bold claims about self-driving capabilities that overpromise and underdeliver,"" the organization said after the Tesla event on Monday. ""We've heard promises of self-driving vehicles from Tesla before.

The video, which shows smoke coming from a white car before it bursts into flames, was posted on social media site Weibo. The vehicle was not moving or being charged at the time of the explosion. The car maker said it would investigate the matter and that there were no reported casualties. ""We immediately sent a team on site and we're supporting local authorities to establish the facts,"" the company said in a statement. Tesla did not confirm the car model, but social media users identified it as a Model-S.  It was not the first time this model has had problems with fire, with a Model-S bursting into flames while driving in Los Angeles in June. Despite the fires, Tesla has previously said petrol-fuelled cars were 10 times more likely to catch fire than those powered by electric batteries. China is the world's largest market for electric vehicles, and Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has pledged to build a ""Gigafactory"" on the outskirts of Shanghai to produce Tesla 3 and Y models.  The explosion in the Shanghai carpark came as Mr Musk announced Tesla would convert its electric cars into fully self-driving vehicles next year as part of an audacious plan to create a network of robotic taxis to compete against Uber and other ride-hailing services. The vision sketched out on Monday (local time) during an event at Tesla's Silicon Valley headquarters requires several leaps of faith — something the zealous investors and consumers who view Mr Musk as a technological genius often are willing to take. But self-driving car experts fear Mr Musk is shirking public safety in an effort to boost Tesla's stock and sell more of the company's electric cars. Questions remain about whether the 15-year-old automaker can consistently make money. ""It sounds like a pipe dream that he's selling people,"" said Raj Rajkumar, an electrical and computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University. ""I think it's basically overpromising, which is typical of Elon Musk.""  To prove his sceptics wrong, Mr Musk will have to persuade regulators that Tesla's technology for transforming potentially hundreds of thousands of electric cars into self-driving vehicles will produce robots that are safer and more reliable than humans. And to do that, Mr Musk will have to be correct in his bet that Tesla has come up with a better way to produce self-driving cars than virtually every other of the more than 60 companies in the US working towards the same goal. Some of those companies are aiming to have their fully autonomous cars begin carrying passengers in small geographic areas as early as this year, but many experts do not believe they will be in widespread use for a decade or more. Mr Musk, widely known for his swagger as much as his smarts, spent much of the time trying to persuade both the investors and consumers that he had figured out a better way to teach robots how to drive. ""It is fundamentally insane to buy anything other than a Tesla,"" Mr Musk said at one point, arguing that purchasing a vehicle from any other automaker would be like getting a horse.  From Mr Musk's vantage point, Tesla has a huge advantage over autonomous vehicle competitors because it gathers a massive amount of data in the real world. This quarter, he said Tesla would have 500,000 vehicles on the road, each equipped with eight cameras, ultrasonic sensors and radar-gathering data to help build the company's neural network, which will serve as the digital equivalent of the self-driving cars' consciousness. The network allows vehicles to recognise images, determine what objects are and figure out how to deal with them. To become fully self-driving, the cars also need a special computer that fits behind the glove box and is powered by a special chip Mr Musk boasted is better than any other processor in the world ""by a huge margin"". Finally, Tesla will deliver software updates to those computers to make it possible for its electric cars to be driven by a robot, without a human in position to take over in case something goes awry. Mr Musk predicted the technology for fully self-driving Teslas will roll out at some point from April to June next year. Then, Tesla would need to get regulatory approval for the fully autonomous cars to drive on roads, something Mr Musk predicted would happen in a few US states by the end of next year.

Mr Musk told investors he expected regulators to approve ride-hailing in some areas for autonomous vehicles. He added: ""I feel very confident in predicting autonomous robotaxis next year."" Mr Musk said he expected the scheme to operate on a model similar to that of Uber or Airbnb. The company unveiled computer hardware for what it said was ""full self-driving"" capabilities in the form of the new microchip. There are still technical and legal challenges ahead for driverless cars, which currently are not deemed as sophisticated or roadworthy as cars with drivers, nor safe enough for public roads. Mr Musk said its custom-designed chip was the best available and a significant milestone in self-driving. Tesla's vehicles are not yet at the standard of autonomy needed to earn the tag ""self-driven"". Level 4 autonomy means a vehicle can drive itself with a human on standby, with level 5 the standard needed before it can be called truly autonomous of human agency.

The firm says untapped potential is likely to result from what has been a turbulent path over the past four months. ""The opportunity to add alpha at the stock and sector level is even larger than normal following equity, credit and rates dislocations caused by the 4Q recession scare and 1Q recovery,"" a group of Goldman derivatives strategists led by John Marshall wrote in a client note. Read more: Amazon, Tesla, and more: Here are the 5 single-stock trades Goldman Sachs says can make you a killing this earnings season If you don't believe them, just look at what happened during first-quarter earnings season: Price swings were large, relative to history, and there were big profits to be captured in just a short time. To that end, the firm has formulated a trading strategy that could be a big moneymaker this time around. It is as follows: An investor buys the first out-of-the-money call contract on a stock five days ahead of earnings and then sells it one day after the report. (Note: The purchase of a call is a bet that the underlying stock will increase.) According to Goldman, the trade returned a whopping 42% last quarter. And while past performance is no guarantee of future returns, the firm notes in the chart below that the call-buying strategy has historically been profitable, even if 42% looks like an anomaly. Goldman Sachs Further, it must be noted that the strategy may not even be particularly aberrant if the types of price dislocations mentioned by Goldman end up surfacing. In terms of specific stock recommendations, Goldman also recently put together five single-stock options trades. Factoring in the work done by the firm's industry analysts, the suggestions are an ideal hybrid of fundamental and technical analysis. ""Options prices are low across the majority of single stocks ahead of this earnings season,"" Marshall and his team said. ""For investors with a view that an upcoming catalyst is likely to move a stock in a meaningful way, option buying strategies appear unusually attractive.""

The New York International Auto Show, open to the public through April 28, is ground zero for next-generation car technology and also home to several vehicles that offer in-car and exterior monitoring systems. From upgraded blind spot cams to facial recognition software installed in the dash, cars on display are equipped with several sets of digital eyes that can improve vehicle security, safety and convenience. Some of the cameras can help propel cars closer toward an autonomous future by enabling the vehicle to see what's around it. Others are installed to combat drunk driving by analyzing the driver's face and behavior.  Retire early: Can ordinary Americans find financial independence and stop work by 50? Size 9-3/4: Vans announces Harry Potter-themed shoes, apparel and accessories are coming soon  Last year, onboard cameras were on the top of motorists' wishlists, according to auto trends search data released by Google. Auto companies like Kia, BMW, Tesla and General Motors are positioning themselves to meet the increasing demand. Almost everywhere. Cadillac's new CT5 compact sedan has a hands-free driving assistant that can navigate most U.S. highways on its own, as long as the driver stays attentive. Unveiled at the auto show, there's a camera on top of the steering column that monitors the driver’s awareness. The 2020 Hyundai Sonata, which made its first stop in North America at the auto show, has five cameras installed throughout the car – four of which are used to provide the driver with an enhanced bird’s eye view of the vehicle’s exterior.  The sedan has front-facing cameras, mirror mounted cameras, a rearview camera and ultrasonic sensors that project sound waves to detect the proximity of objects to the vehicle. BMW has an optional driver monitoring camera in its new 2019 X5 SUV. The video camera is mounted in the digital dashboard as part of BMW’s Extended Traffic Jam Assistant system to make sure the driver is paying attention to the road ahead. Tesla cars are also bespeckled with cameras, both internally and externally. Eight surround-cameras give new Tesla's 360 degrees of visibility, helping the semi-autonomous cars see the world around them. Displays confuse the cops: Tesla Model 3 confuses police officer who thinks a computer is mounted on the dashboard Some go straight to the manufacturer. With all these cameras and sensors, modern cars can collect details about driving habits that some automakers use for future innovations like digital road maps that can help with autonomous driving. BMW, for example, provides real-time vehicle data to the mapping software company HERE. The data is being used to develop a range of connected vehicle services, according to HERE.  Some of the data and images never leave the car. The computers on Tesla vehicles house information that drivers voluntarily save. The information can be erased through a factory reset. Still, the autonomous car maker came under scrutiny last month after a hacker discovered that Teslas found in junkyards still contained the driver’s stored videos, location and navigational data. Big savings, but there's a catch: T-Mobile gets into banking, offering 4% interest and no fees on its free checking account Wind in your hair? Yaasss! Convertibles aren't quite dead yet as models hang on Getting data from your own Tesla after a wreck requires that you buy a proprietary cable that costs $995. The software required to use the hardware is free.  Modern cars: Is your car hackable? Cybersecurity experts say it might be Consumers want onboard cameras that go beyond recording the road ahead, according to Google’s auto trend data, and that’s precisely what car makers are offering. With 16 cameras and sensors, the 2019 Kia K900 was built to eliminate blind spots. Cameras on the outside of the car offer a clear view of your blind spots on the digital dashboard. The 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLS SUV uses forward-scanning cameras and mapping data to tilt the car into corners for a smoother ride on and off road. Mercedes says it ""ensures superior suspension comfort, agile handling and good off-road capabilities."" In 2016, the Cadillac CT6 introduced a video recording system for added sedan security and a head tracking system that helps make sure your eyes stay on the road. Captured footage is stored on a standard SD card in the truck of the vehicle. Cameras might also soon be able to reduce risky behavior. Volvo announced in March that it “believes intoxication and distraction should be addressed by installing in-car cameras and other sensors that monitor the driver and allow the car to intervene.”  Early next year, the company will be installing in-cabin cameras in all of its vehicles. Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter to explain why there’s a tiny camera installed above the rearview mirror in Model 3s. Musk said that the camera will help the Palo Alto-based company compete with ride-sharing giants in the future.  ""It’s there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft & people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet. In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video,"" Musk said in a tweet.  Unlike dashboard cameras you can stick on your windshield, automakers are building extra sets of eyes directly into the car’s body. So one of the only ways to avoid them if you want 21st-century vehicle safety is to buy a car that doesn’t use them or opt out of optional advanced safety features. However, finding a new vehicle that doesn't have at least one onboard camera may be more difficult as time goes on. New cars sold in the U.S. are required to have backup cameras to help drivers avoid accidents under a federal regulation that took effect last year. The regulation requires rearview cameras and video displays on all new models to prevent accidents in which pedestrians are run over because a driver can't see them as they back up their vehicles. The global automotive camera market is expected to almost double in the next 6 years, increasing to a 15 billion-dollar industry, according to a new global forecast report by Research and Markets. Worried about privacy? Some cameras, like the rearview mirror camera on Tesla cars, come with a sliding panel so you can cover it up if you're worried about being watched.

The video shows a Model 3 drive itself without any interaction from the ""driver,"" if you don't count him choosing a destination on the car's navigation system. We already know that Tesla cars can more or less drive autonomously on a highway. But in this video, the Model 3 is driving on all sorts of roads, making turns and stopping at traffic lights — all by itself. The entire length of the ride, which according to this Redditor starts and ends at Tesla's headquarters in Palo Alto, is about 12 miles, and it takes about 18 minutes to complete (the video is sped up, so that time is compressed into less than two minutes). Tesla released a similar video of a Model X driving autonomously in 2016, but the new video appears to be a single take, whereas the video from 2016 was edited.

But Nvidia, which also makes hardware designed for self-driving cars, said on Tuesday that Tesla made an inaccurate comparison between the two companies' technologies. During an event for investors centered around autonomous-driving technology, Tesla compared its Full Self-Driving (FSD) Computer against Nvidia's Drive Xavier computer, saying the FSD Computer has more processing power. According to Tesla, the FSD Computer is capable of 144 trillion operations per second (TOPS), while Nvidia's Drive Xavier is capable of 21 TOPS. Read more: Tesla claims it has made the 'best chip in the world' for self-driving cars at its autonomy day event Nvidia disputed Tesla's comparison in a blog post, saying the Drive Xavier is capable of 3o TOPS, but is designed for semi-autonomous driver-assistance tasks, rather than complete autonomy. Nvidia's Drive AGX Pegasus computer, which is designed for full autonomy and capable of 320 TOPS, is a more accurate point of comparison, the company said. ""It's not useful to compare the performance of Tesla's two-chip Full Self Driving computer against Nvidia's single-chip driver assistance system. Tesla's two-chip FSD computer at 144 TOPs would compare against the Nvidia DRIVE AGX Pegasus computer which runs at 320 TOPS for AI perception, localization, and path planning. ""Additionally, while Xavier delivers 30 TOPS of processing, Tesla erroneously stated that it delivers 21 TOPS. Moreover, a system with a single Xavier processor is designed for assisted driving AutoPilot features, not full self-driving. Self-driving, as Tesla asserts, requires a good deal more compute."" Nvidia credited Tesla for focusing on developing the significant computing power necessary for self-driving vehicles, but suggested that Nvidia's technology, by allowing customers to build on top of it, is superior. ""Tesla, however, has the most important issue fully right: Self-driving cars — which are key to new levels of safety, efficiency, and convenience — are the future of the industry.

""I feel very confident predicting 1 million autonomous robo-taxis for Tesla next year,"" Musk told a room of investors and Wall Street analysts at the company's Palo Alto, California, headquarters. ""Not in all jurisdictions because we won't have regulatory approval everywhere, but I'm confident we will have regulatory approval at least somewhere, literally next year. "" Tesla estimates the cost of running a robo-taxi on the ""Tesla Network,"" onto which the company says all Tesla owners will be able to add their cars, to be less than $0.18 a mile. Tesla went on to predict that a sample fare of $1 a mile would translate to $30,000 in annual profit for a single car. That would add up to $30 billion for the 1 million cars Musk predicted would soon be running. This slide from Musk's presentation explains the revenue breakdown as Tesla envisions.
Tesla ""Expect this to operate sort of like a combination of the Uber and the Airbnb model,"" Musk said. ""So if you own the car, you can add or subtract it to the Tesla network and Tesla would take 15 or 20% of the revenue. In places where there aren't enough people sharing their cars we would just have dedicated Tesla vehicles."" Autonomy is key for ride-hailing, and not just for Tesla. Uber and Lyft, easily the two biggest companies in the space, are spending huge chunks of their revenue on paying drivers. Many Wall Street analysts have suggested that with self-driving cars, that expense could be minimized, giving both companies a gateway to profitability. Wikimedia Commons
Of course, not everyone was so quick to accept Musk's vision. The billionaire, after all, has a track record of making grandiose promises that don't pan out on the same scale or timeline. Jim Cramer of CNBC went so far on the air as to compare Musk to the circus leader PT Barnum. Wall Street analysts were also underwhelmed. ""The Tesla Network robotaxi plans seemed half baked, with the company appearing to either not have answers to or not even considered pretty basic question on the pricing, insurance liability, or regulatory and legal requirements,"" Jeff Osborne, an analyst at Cowen, said in a note to clients on Tuesday. ""We see the focus on FSD as a desperate attempt to convince Tesla car buyers to pay the $8,000 for the ""FSD"" option, even though the company acknowledges the software doesn't work and they will have a new next-gen solution in ~2 years.""",elon musk says tesla million road next year people think claim unrealistic compared pt barnum tsla,elon musk unveiled grand plans tesla network monday sights set million autonomous electric vehicles shuttling passengers within year feel confident predicting million autonomous tesla next year musk told room investors wall street analysts company palo alto california headquarters jurisdictions wo regulatory approval everywhere confident regulatory approval least somewhere literally next tesla estimates cost running tesla network onto company says tesla owners able add cars less mile tesla went predict sample fare mile would translate annual profit single car would add billion million cars musk predicted would soon running slide musk presentation explains revenue breakdown tesla envisions tesla expect operate sort like combination uber airbnb model musk said car add subtract tesla network tesla would take revenue places enough people sharing cars would dedicated tesla vehicles autonomy key tesla uber lyft easily two biggest companies space spending huge chunks revenue paying drivers many wall street analysts suggested cars expense could minimized giving companies gateway profitability wikimedia commons course everyone quick accept musk vision billionaire track record making grandiose promises pan scale timeline jim cramer cnbc went far air compare musk circus leader pt barnum wall street analysts also underwhelmed tesla network robotaxi plans seemed half baked company appearing either answers even considered pretty basic question pricing insurance liability regulatory legal requirements jeff osborne analyst cowen said note clients tuesday see focus fsd desperate attempt convince tesla car buyers pay fsd option even though company acknowledges software work new solution years

That has attracted a passionate base of consumers, as well as social media supporters. Elon Musk has 25 million followers on Twitter. Tesla also fits the ESG (environmental, social and governance) approach to stock market buying now in favor with a new generation of investors. ""If we're talking about the 'E' here, there is enormous upside potential in cost savings, the prospect of regulatory changes and, most of all, the biggest group of consumers (and ultimately investors) ever — millennials — whose priorities are very ESG-related. All of those things make Tesla (Musk's issues aside) an appealing prospect,"" said one institutional investor. But that institutional investor no longer owns Tesla. They sold because Musk's leadership wasn't delivering on the G — the governance part of the ESG philosophy. Since just about one year ago, the Tesla CEO has called a Wall Street analyst ""bonehead"" (May 2018); had a random Twitter feud with a diver that took part in the Thai cave rescue (July 2018); and, most recently, has been involved in a legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission stemming from his August 2018 tweet about a deal to take the company private, a deal that never materialized. Things got so ugly with the SEC — which could ask for Musk to be removed from management — that a federal judge recently asked the two parties to put on their ""reasonableness pants"" and reach an agreement. There are signs that Musk's outbursts during a critical period for the company could be scaring off some of the biggest fund managers. Reuters recently reported that one of the top institutional fund holders, T. Rowe Price, had made large cuts in Tesla shares it held across several of its funds. ""He is a huge focus of Tesla fanatics on the bull side,"" said Dan Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. ""It's the passion for EVs and what Tesla has built, and enthusiasts who believe this is a company that will change consumer society."" But that kind of support can be dangerous for stock market investors, who cannot afford to be emotional when their money is at stake. The middle ground is not a very popular place to be when it comes to Tesla. ""I have covered tech for two decades, so many different names, shapes and sizes, but this is the most emotional bull-bear battleground stock I have ever covered,"" said Ives. One of the company's earliest officials, two-time CFO Deepak Ahuja — who retired for the second time in 2018 after coming back to help the company through one of its many difficult financial stretches — has suggested that from day one controversy was inevitable. ""There has been no [new] successful American car company in 100 years, and then to make it an electric-car company in California that is vertically integrated in its manufacturing and wants to challenge the dealership network and do its own sales and service — that's an incredibly hard thing to take on,"" said Ahuja in a speech after his first retirement. ""All your dirty laundry is out in the public. Tesla is especially the kind of company people either love to love or love to hate."" Said Ives, ""It hits on disruptive technology, autos and oil."" For ESG investors it can be difficult to understand how a stock designed to create a better future can be on the receiving end of so much negativity. The brief history of renewable-energy stocks shows this shouldn't be a surprise. Volatility has proved to be endemic to renewable-energy investing. Consider one of the first big renewable-energy stocks in the U.S.: First Solar. It went public in 2006 at $20, rose as high as $300 within a few years, and then it traded down to as low as $11 by 2012 as bankruptcy fears rippled through the solar sector. Even after surviving a shakeout in the solar business, which involved declining government incentives around the world and increased, heavily funded competition from China (two factors that figure in Tesla's future), the volatile ride hasn't stopped for the solar leader. In the last two years, FSLR shares have been as low as $27 and as high as $80. It is trading around $60 this week. ""Bears have a very good memory of what happened with FSLR, and when you look at TSLA, there are some of the same characteristics,"" Ives said, though he stressed it requires painting both scenarios with broad brushstrokes. These are new industries where ""story stocks"" can stoke enthusiasm from retail investors and many long-term investing asset-management firms are willing to be patient, to a point, through ups and downs in trading. David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital made a bet against First Solar that paid off when the solar sector bottomed out in 2012. He recently slammed Tesla, saying in a letter to investors, ""The wheels are falling off — literally."" Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates, a short seller who has had some notable winning short bets, including Enron and First Solar, has been vocally negative on Musk and Tesla. As of mid-April (before the first quarter earnings report on Wednesday), about 27% of Tesla's public float — the shares available to trade on the open market — were short the stock, according to mid-April market data. Short bets can run above 60% of available shares, but Tesla isn't a micro-cap stock like many of those companies. Even after a year-to-date decline of roughly 30%, Tesla is still a $40 billion company, though Ford passed it in market value on Friday — in April 2017 Tesla had surpassed Ford's market value for the first time. GM remains the biggest of the three, with a market value above $56 billion. Even after several recent rounds of layoffs, Tesla employs roughly 40,000 people. ""Most investors or analysts that cover autos, they almost have cororaries when they look at the valuation. Investors who are bullish are disruptive technology investors,"" Ives said before the Wednesday earnings. ""The risks have increased over the past six months, and now we view it as a fork-in-the-road stock."" Investors who are enamored of the Tesla mission and are willing to overlook Musk's recent feuds need to remember that cash flow, profitability, manufacturing execution and market demand are the make-or-break issues for the company and its shareholders. Tesla reported a bigger than expected loss in its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the bell, with deliveries of cars declining and its cash a continuing concern. For the first time in a while, Musk conceded the company may need to raise more capital. Tesla recently pay back close to $1 billion to holders of its debt. ""Right now the bears are having a field day,"" Ives said. Before the earnings, he said, ""This is not a stock that will be sitting at $260 at the end of the year. It will either be meaningfully higher or lower."" He had a $365 price target on Tesla before its first quarter earnings. After the earnings, Ives went to neutral and a target of $275, saying there are too many outstanding questions about demand and cost structure for the long-term promise to outweigh the risks right now. He expected all along the company would need to raise more capital this year (Morgan Stanley estimated a $2.5 billion raise after the results). That will pressure shares in the short-term even though longer-term it should provide breathing room, Ives said before the results, but his tone was increasingly negative after earnings, writing in a note, ""We view this quarter as one of top debacles we have ever seen while Musk & Co. in an episode out of the Twilight Zone act as if demand and profitability will magically return to the Tesla story."" Ives said the most bears have shifted from conspiracy theories — with drones flying over the gigafactory and Fremont, California, car plant, looking for signs the company won't even exist — to a focus on production and demand numbers that at times Tesla has been able to hit, which surprised even bears. ""This is the early stages of a massive market opportunity, and many investors are viewing the competition looming and think Tesla's best days are in the rear view,"" Ives said. ""We disagree, but that makes it a prove-me story."" In his post-earnings note, Ives wrote, ""We no longer can look investors in the eye and recommend buying this stock at current levels until Tesla starts to take its medicine and focus on reality around demand issues which is the core focus of investors."" Despite short-term troubles, Tesla stock has done well since its 2010 IPO. At least to date, the chart has been much better to the early bulls than long-time bears. The long-term Tesla bulls include a few top-performing managers who are concentrated in their ownership, billionaire mutual fund manager Ron Baron of Baron Capital Management, and Catherine Wood's at Ark Invest. Some of their enthusiasm can seem extreme: Last year Wood called for a Tesla stock price of $4,000 by 2023. But one thing these two managers share is strong performance. Baron is one of the few of the old breed of active mutual fund managers who over the long-term has still managed to perform well versus index funds. Wood's Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK), meanwhile, has the top ranking in its category over the past three-year period, according to Morningstar. Wood stresses the disruptive technology view of Tesla and efforts like autonomous driving. On Monday, Musk made his most extended sales pitch for autonomous vehicles yet at an investor day, saying Teslas will be able to serve as robo-taxis for their owners by next year and owning any other car would be like owning a horse. Others on Wall Street have said the autonomous driving plans unveiled by the company are ""half-baked."" Baron made a different disruptive argument for Tesla at one of his annual Baron shareholder meetings a few years ago. Tesla was at that time also facing concerns about its balance sheet, but Baron shrugged it off. He argued that being a traditional auto manufacturer was the dangerous balance sheet position because the massive manufacturing plants that these automakers own today will be worthless when the world goes full-throttle to EVs. Further, Baron argued that the car dealership model is another future financial sinkhole in the car industry. Some dealers agree. Baron's bullish views about Tesla can help explain why some of the most consistently negative voices on Musk's company come from auto executives. ""Tesla has no ... tech advantage, no software advantage, no battery advantage. No advantages whatsoever,"" Bob Lutz, former vice chairman of General Motors, who also worked at BMW, Chrysler and Ford, told CNBC. In 2017 Lutz said Tesla is a ""losing enterprise"" that won't last. ""The company, folks, is going out of business. At this rate they'll never get to 2019."" Tesla's entire model is built around putting car dealerships out of business. In states across the country, Tesla has had to fight with lawmakers over the right to sell EVs without dealers being included. Mike Jackson, former head of the nation's largest car dealership company AutoNation, has been a vocal critic of Tesla. He said by using ""bait-and-switch"" tactics on consumers, promising a $35,000 Model 3 years ago but delaying its introduction, Musk acted ""almost unethically."" Jackson does believe electric cars are here to stay and will grow considerably in the next decade, but said Tesla may not be in business 10 years from now. Jackson claims to have no beef with Tesla or Musk and points out AutoNation never challenged Tesla's distribution model that avoids dealers. He would even sell a Tesla if the company agreed to offer it through dealers. Expiring government incentives are another focus for the bears. Current fears in the market are that the waning tax credits for EV buyers in the U.S. are behind declining Tesla sales and that will continue to be the trajectory. A Nikkei report on April 12 said that Panasonic and Tesla, partners on battery production at Tesla's Nevada gigafactory, were pulling back on expansion plans for this year, which reinforced fears that demand for Tesla cars will not rebound quickly. At the end of last year, the $7,500 federal tax credits for buying a Tesla ended because the company reached a maximum number of cars sold that were eligible and fell to $3,750 at the beginning of 2019, and will be retired at the end of the year. A group of bipartisan senators has introduced a bill to extend those EV tax credits from 200,000 to 400,000 vehicles. The new bill dubbed the ""Driving America Forward Act"" would grant each automaker a $7,000 tax credit for an additional 400,000 vehicles. After a recent Wall Street Journal editorial arguing that the loss of the tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases was a bigger issue than Tesla fans would accept, Musk took to Twitter to call the WSJ and the writer ""sock puppets"" of Big Oil. New industries reliant on government support can face a double-edged sword. First Solar shares and shares across the solar sector boomed during a period of years when European Union countries, led by Germany, were offering large feed-in tariffs for the development of solar power projects. The incentives were required to stimulate demand, grow the industry and allows its manufacturing companies to develop cost-effective economies of scale. But the importance of the incentives also led to massive volatility in solar stocks, and played a role in bankruptcies. Big oil isn't in denial about EVs. If anything, passengers cars are the only part of the transportation industry where oil companies see rapid growth coming. The widely read long-term energy outlook from BP predicts that the share of oil within the transportation sector declines to around 85% by 2040, down from 94% currently. Natural gas, electricity and biofuels together account for more than half of the increase in energy used in transport, with each providing around 5% of transport demand by 2040. BP does see greater growth for EVs, specifically. ""The number of electric vehicles reaches around 350 million by 2040, of which around 300 million are passenger cars. This is equivalent to around 15% of all cars,"" BP wrote in the most recent update of this annual report. The oil giant also predicts the emergence of autonomous cars (AVs) in the 2020s will result in around 25% of passenger vehicle miles traveled being powered by electricity in 2040. More competition is entering the global EV market in regions where Tesla needs to find new demand. Last October, it was reported that Tesla's largest fund management shareholder, Baillee Gifford, was taking a stake in Chinese electric car company Nio. Nio is one of several Chinese automakers with plans to make cars for the Chinese market initially, but it also has ambitions to expand into Europe and the U.S. The threat to Tesla is real as the Chinese market becomes increasingly important as a new source of demand for Musk's company. Tesla is now building a plant in China. China's government ambitions, and support for renewable energy and manufacturing, are hugely influential on a global scale. The Chinese government and its massive lending apparatus was as responsible for the solar industry shakeout as any single factor. It funded the development of giant solar panel and solar cell manufacturing companies to soak up the incentives being offered across Europe when they were at a peak. Even as that strategy resulted in several of its own companies ending in bankruptcy, the Chinese solar industry remains huge today.",tesla battleground stock,tesla solar energy businesses tick big

CEO John Krafcik wrote Tuesday in a Medium post that the company will repurpose an existing facility in Motor City with the goal of being operational by mid-2019. Back in January, the company announced it had chosen southeast Michigan as the location of its new facility for the mass production of L4 autonomous vehicles, the first of its kind in the world. The company will create anywhere between 100 to 400 jobs as a result of the venture, according to The Detroit Free Press. Waymo will also receive incentives from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation. ""We will partner with American Axle & Manufacturing to repurpose an existing facility, bringing a workforce back to an area where jobs in the automotive industry were recently lost,"" Krafcik wrote. He also added that the location would allow Waymo to take advantage of Michigan's strong talent pool in engineering, operations and fleet coordination. The Detroit facility should open at a time when Waymo is dramatically expanding its operations. The automaker owned by Alphabet Inc said it would double its operations in Arizona earlier this year. Waymo's announcement comes as Michigan is still grappling with GM's decision to pull back from two factories in the state. GM will stop production at the Detroit-Hamtramck plant in January 2020, which built the electric vehicle Chevy Volt. GM is still planning on building production versions of its self-driving Cruise car at the Orion Assembly Plant in Michigan. While it likely won't make up for the job loss due to GM's departure, a few other automakers are also building new operations in Michigan. Fiat Chrysler announced in February that it will build a new Jeep factory in Detroit. Back in March, Ford said it will build EVs in its facility in Flat Rock, Michigan, and devote a facility elsewhere in Southwest Michigan to build autonomous vehicles. Waymo, along with Uber, General Motors and Tesla, are currently in a race to be the first to make their autonomous vehicles available nationwide. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said earlier this week that the company plans to launch a robo-taxi service in 2020.

Reddit user ""greentheonly"" posted a pretty technical analysis of upcoming hardware and software updates to Tesla's autopilot technology back in January. (Greentheonly included things like ""program operations are pipelined with data loads and computations interleaved and weight fetching happening well upstream from the instructions that actually use those weights."") Then on Tuesday — after Tesla tweeted a list of the self-driving hardware now being built into its cars — someone shared a link to the Reddit post, tagging Tesla and Elon Musk.   Musk saw the analysis and responded, tweeting it was ""mostly correct"" and calling Reddit ""hardcore."" Musk then said whoever wrote the analysis should interview for a job at Tesla.  Neither the author of the Reddit analysis or Tesla immediately responded to CNBC Make It's request for comment. Even if Musk doesn't personally invite you to apply to work at Tesla, the company does have guidelines for what makes a successful applicant: love the mission; demonstrate you're innovative, driven, collaborative and trustworthy; and be ready to demonstrate your skills, not just talk about them — like the Redditor did. ""We are big believers in showing us what you can do, versus telling us what you can do,"" Cindy Nicola, Tesla's then head of global recruiting, told CNBC Make It in 2018. ""So for example, if you were an engineering candidate and you were coming in, there might be some coding test or some problem solving that we would do on a whiteboard."" ""We are extremely mission-driven. There's a lot of energy in the world around what we're trying to do. We have really tough problems to solve, so I think people want to be a part of that,"" Nicola said. ""There's not many companies that you can work at today where there's really a direct impact between the work you do and changing the world.""

After a second half of 2018 in which Tesla finished in the black, Wall Street is expecting a money-losing quarter. The loss has been pegged at anywhere from less than $1 per share to nearly $2. Tesla shares are down about 14% year-to-date, and CEO Elon Musk already said that the company won't post three straight profitable quarters. Markets appear to have priced in the negative result, as shares are actually up marginally over the past month. Read more: Elon Musk thinks it's 'financially insane' to buy a car that isn't a Tesla — but Tesla wouldn't be able to make enough cars to meet that demand With this knowledge, investors should be zeroing in on three key aspects of Tesla's numbers: For the fourth quarter of 2018, Tesla brought in more than $7 billion, a serious top-line surge. Despite Tesla's volatility on the bottom line, the company is starting to rake in serious money. That makes sense. Tesla delivered about 250,000 vehicles in 2018. Those vehicles were priced between $50,000 and $150,000. Carmakers enjoy huge amounts of cash sloshing through their businesses, and now that Tesla has captured about 3% of the US market share, it can expect the same. That said, revenue should retreat for the first quarter. The big questions is, ""How much?"" Investors will want to see if Tesla can regain top-line momentum and start looking forward to $10 billion quarters. Tesla paid off a roughly $900 million convertible bond earlier this year, depleting some of its cash balance, which was north of $3 billion. The expectation is that operations will send Tesla's cash reserve down to about $1 billion by the end of the year, which is skinny for an automaker and could presage a capital raise at some point in 2019 to cushion the balance sheet. Tesla amasses zero-emission-vehicle (ZEV) credits because it sells only all-electric vehicles. (Tesla also racks up non-ZEV credits that are calculated on different metrics than ZEVs.) It can sell these at any time, bringing in millions. Musk has complained about how various ZEV schemes end up discounting Tesla's ZEVs, but they still represent a useful revenue source, and Tesla hasn't really tapped into them since last year. Investors will likely be curious about whether Tesla sold some credits to offset an otherwise more severe loss. On another note, investors will also be listening in to Tesla's earnings call after the numbers are announced to assess the interactions of Deepak Ahuja, Tesla's outgoing chief financial officer, and Zach Kirkhorn, the incoming CFO, who will take over the position toward the end of 2019.",investors looking things tesla earnings tsla,tesla report earnings bell wednesday second half tesla finished black wall street expecting quarter loss pegged anywhere less per share nearly tesla shares ceo elon musk already said company wo post three straight profitable quarters markets appear priced negative result shares actually marginally past month read elon musk thinks insane buy car tesla tesla would able make enough cars meet demand knowledge investors zeroing three key aspects tesla numbers fourth quarter tesla brought billion serious surge despite tesla volatility bottom line company starting rake serious money makes sense tesla delivered vehicles vehicles priced carmakers enjoy huge amounts cash sloshing businesses tesla captured us market share expect said revenue retreat first quarter big questions much investors want see tesla regain momentum start looking forward billion quarters tesla paid roughly million convertible bond earlier year depleting cash balance north billion expectation operations send tesla cash reserve billion end year skinny automaker could presage capital raise point cushion balance sheet tesla amasses zev credits sells vehicles tesla also racks credits calculated different metrics zevs sell time bringing millions musk complained various zev schemes end discounting tesla zevs still represent useful revenue source tesla really tapped since last year investors likely curious whether tesla sold credits offset otherwise severe loss another note investors also listening tesla earnings call numbers announced assess interactions deepak ahuja tesla outgoing chief financial officer zach kirkhorn incoming cfo take position toward end

Tesla's aggressive (perhaps unrealistic) goal to launch a robotaxi network in 2020 was revealed by CEO Elon Musk on Monday as the company discussed plans toward a self-driving future. Under Musk's strategy, the electric car maker will enable owners to add their autonomous driving-capable vehicles to a Tesla ride-sharing app, which he described as a combination of Uber and Airbnb. “From our standpoint, if you fast forward a year – maybe a year and three months, but next year for sure – we’ll have over a million robotaxis on the road,” Musk told an audience on Monday. “The fleet wakes up with an over-the-air update; that’s all it takes,” he said. At face value, the promise that Tesla owners can make $30,000 per year adding their cars to the Tesla Network sounds great – especially as an increasing number of Americans search for side gigs and supplemental income. On a slightly deeper level, the idea of having a stranger hop behind the wheel of your hi-tech car raises more questions than Musk or anyone else from Telsa has answered. Surveillance: Where are the cameras in your car and what are they looking for? Robotaxi candidates: Could these Teslas bring in $60k a year for the family? That's yet to be seen. The CEO is very optimistic that Tesla cars on the road today are an over-the-air update away from being fully self-driving capable. “By the middle of next year, we’ll have over a million Tesla cars on the road with full self-driving hardware, feature complete, at a reliability level that we would consider that no one needs to pay attention,” Musk said. However, so far, Tesla has been officially positioning its Autopilot system as more of an advanced driver assistance feature that requires the driver's attentiveness. Motorists can use it to help with parking and making lane changes, but Telsa has yet to show its cars at Level 4 Autonomy where the vehicle can perform all driving tasks, while monitoring the driving environment itself, and the driver could, say, take a nap. The Partners for Automated Vehicle Education industry group advise on Twitter against over-promising on the state of autonomous technology. At least to start, the cars used in the fleet will be equipped with steering wheels and pedals, so the stranger behind the wheel might have some level of control. But who's responsible if something happens to the car? It's unclear. “The Tesla Network robotaxi plans seemed half-baked, with the company appearing to either not have answers to or not even considered pretty basic question on the pricing, insurance liability, or regulatory and legal requirements,” said Cowen’s analyst Jeffrey Osborne in a note on Tuesday. In places where there aren’t enough shared cars, Tesla would provide its own dedicated vehicles, including Model 3, S and X taxis, so clearly the company would take care of the maintenance on those cars. Drivers for ride-hailing companies like Lyft and Uber are independent contractors, so just about any money spent on the gig becomes a tax-deductible business expense. Along with the water, gum and snacks for passengers, any car tech you may pay for is also tax deductible, according to TurboTax. Tesla didn't say whether this would apply to owners of its currently semi-autonomous cars. Perhaps owners could write off pricey software upgrades. In February, the Palo Alto-based company increased the price of its Autopilot package by $5,000 and added a few new features.  Only time will tell. Tesla’s Uber alternative has been in the works for a few years. Musk announced the project as part of a broader “master plan” for the company in 2016. Still, that timeline seems ambitious, and Musk has admitted that he is often fairly criticized for not meeting deadlines. “Only criticism, and it’s a fair one, (is that) sometimes I’m not on time,” Musk said, laughing. “But I get it done, and the Tesla team gets it done.” Musk also acknowledged that government regulations may be a hindrance to his 2020 timeline. At least 41 states and the District of Columbia have considered legislation related to autonomous vehicles. In 2018, the House of Representatives passed autonomous vehicle legislation H.R. 3388 to create uniform standards for self-driving cars.

The 20,000 flamethrowers Musk sold were essentially roofing torches encased in an air rifle shell. They were valued at $500. They sold out in five days. Musk later called the contraption ""a terrible idea."" ""You shouldn't buy one,"" Musk said in the ""Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast in September. ""I said don't buy this flamethrower. Don't buy it. Don't buy it, that's what I said. But still, people bought it. There was nothing I could do to stop them. I could not stop them. I said don't buy it, it's a bad idea."" ""It's dangerous, it's wrong. Don't buy it,"" he added. ""Still, people bought it. I just couldn't stop them."" Like the flamethrower, electric leaf blowers already exist.

Both vehicles received drivetrain upgrades that Tesla said would improve the battery performance on the long-range version of both cars to 370 miles for the Model S, and 325 miles for the Model X. Previously, the Model S and Model X had maximum battery ranges of 335 miles and 295 miles, respectively. The long-range Model S and Model X benefit from the extended ranges while using the same 100 kWh battery pack, according to a Tesla blog post published Tuesday. Both cars are now priced higher as a result: $78,750 (a $5,500 hike) for the S and $83,950 (a $6,000 increase) for the X. The electric-car maker bundled a series of other announcements in its press release, including that it is bringing back the lower-cost Standard Range Model S and Model X, a month after they were quietly removed from the Tesla website.

Following up on a promise made in early March, the newest S and X models can also take advantage of faster charging rates using Tesla's new V3 Supercharger and the existing V2 units. All of this news comes a day after CEO Elon Musk hosted an event — dubbed ""Autonomy Day"" — for investors on Monday. During the presentation, Musk touted Tesla's progress on its autonomous-driving technology. The new-and-improved Model S and Model X also dropped just hours before Tesla is set to deliver its first-quarter earnings report.

Rivian, based in Plymouth, Mich., plans to begin producing a pickup truck and a sport utility vehicle by the end of next year. Both will be powered by battery packs and are designed to be luxury vehicles that could appeal to many of the consumers drawn to Tesla and its upscale models. The retail giant Amazon led a $700 million investment in Rivian in February. Ford is counting on the partnership to accelerate its efforts to field a range of electric cars and trucks, while it also pushes to streamline operations, slash costs and increase profitability. The company’s turnaround effort has shown little tangible progress since Jim Hackett became chief executive two years ago. Ford’s stock has fallen about 9 percent since his arrival. On Thursday, Ford is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings, and many analysts expect a decline. In 2018, its profits fell more than 50 percent. “We can learn a lot from Rivian, how quickly they turn around ideas,” Ford’s chairman, William C. Ford Jr., said in an interview. “There’s a great benefit from working with a clean-sheet approach” to electric vehicles. Ford’s investment reflects a changing dynamic in the auto industry as newcomers find a foothold based on technological advances. Traditional automakers like General Motors and Ford have introduced electric vehicles, but Tesla has become the United States market leader by far. And some analysts say Waymo, a division of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has moved to the front in developing autonomous vehicles. “The traditional auto industry is under a lot of pressure to develop tremendously expensive technology, and the way to do that and make it financially viable is by sharing and working with others,” said Rebecca Lindland, founder of RebeccaDrives.com, a new-car information provider. “The demands of the industry are calling for alliances, and you’re seeing that in Ford and Rivian.” Ford and Volkswagen are discussing ways of pooling efforts to develop self-driving technology. G.M. is already working with Honda on autonomous vehicles. That effort also has financial backing from SoftBank, the Japanese technology giant. Rivian, which was founded in 2009 by R. J. Scaringe, an M.I.T.-trained engineer, introduced its truck and S.U.V. in public in November. It builds each model on a chassis, shaped like a skateboard, containing all the components that propel the vehicle — a large battery pack, axles, suspension, cooling system and four electric motors. With a full charge, Rivian’s pickup will have a range of 400 miles, the company says. Mr. Scaringe said that Rivian had held talks with a variety of automakers but that he and Mr. Ford, long a proponent of zero-emissions vehicles, shared a similar vision about developing sustainable transportation. “We believe the world needs to electrify,” he said. Rivian’s pickup, the R1T, and its S.U.V., the R1S, are expected to sell for $68,000 or more. Mr. Scaringe hopes the R1S competes with Tesla’s Model X and S.U.V.s produced by Land Rover and Porsche. Tesla is also working on a pickup. Rivian has set a goal of selling about 20,000 vehicles in 2021 and twice that many in 2022. Tesla sold about 245,000 last year, although sales have slumped this year and Tesla reported a loss for the first quarter on Wednesday. On Monday, Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the company planned to operate a fleet of one million self-driving taxis by the end of next year. Both Ford and Rivian are also developing autonomous driving technology. Like other industry executives, Mr. Scaringe said Mr. Musk’s plans appeared overly optimistic, adding that autonomous driving “will come into play in the next 10 years.” Rivian plans to make its vehicles at a shut-down auto plant in Normal, Ill., that it acquired in 2016. Ford had already planned to spend $11 billion to develop nearly two dozen electric vehicles, including a small S.U.V. due next year and a version of its F-150 pickup truck. The company plans to use Rivian’s skateboard chassis to produce additional models. “We can go faster working with Rivian,” said Joe Hinrichs, president of Ford’s global automotive businesses. Previous investments in Rivian include $500 million from Sumitomo, a Japanese conglomerate known for its tire division, and Abdul Latif Jameel, a Saudi industrial group. Ford’s investment is subject to regulatory approval. The two companies declined to detail how much of an ownership stake Ford would take in Rivian.

Tesla Musk said that all new Tesla vehicles today are built with hardware and computing power necessary for fully autonomous driving. It plans to push through a software update next year, which will then enable its cars to function autonomously. The ride-hailing service — which will launch once Tesla updates its cars' software — will include both privately owned Tesla cars and a fleet owned by Tesla itself. Musk said the company will take a 25-30% cut of fees earned from rides provided by privately owned Teslas. He also added that the service will initially be confined to a limited geographic footprint, though he didn't specify where. Here's what it means: If Tesla were to successfully launch a ride-hailing service using autonomous vehicles (AVs) by the end of 2020, it would likely be the third or fourth entrant into the US AV ride-hailing space. The bigger picture: We believe Tesla is unlikely to meet its goal of launching an autonomous ride-hailing service by the end of next year. The first barrier is Tesla's AV technology. The company has eschewed LiDAR sensors, a 3D image-sensing technology that enables AVs to see the world around them, in favor of cameras and radar to help its AVs navigate. This move has been met with skepticism in the industry: LiDAR is considered superior in gauging the size and distance of objects in motion, which is essential to safe AV operation. Without LiDAR, Tesla's cars may need far more advanced software and computing power to give them full autonomy, and it's not clear that Tesla's offerings will be up to par. Beyond technical limitations, Tesla could run into legal impediments — Musk noted several times during Autonomy Day that Tesla's AV ride-hailing service will require approval from the federal government. However, there currently aren't any federal laws or regulations governing AVs, just a series of non-binding regulations. Instead, there's a myriad of state and local regulations Tesla will likely need to comply with. Navigating such regulations will be a large and time-consuming task. In sum, Tesla's Autonomy Day raised more questions than answers, making us doubtful that Tesla Network will be introduced by next year. The Industry Weighs In: Interested in getting the full story?

Both models are built on a shared “skateboard” style chassis that incorporates the drivetrain and battery pack and can be modified to accommodate a variety of body types. Rivian recently completed a $700 million investment round led by Amazon and was reportedly in discussions with General Motors to create a similar partnership to the one being forged with Ford. ELECTRIC FORD F-150 SPOTTED: Ford CEO Jim Hackett did not reveal the type of vehicle that will be created, or when it will go on sale, but confirmed that it will be in addition to the electric Mustang-inspired SUV and Ford F-150 the automaker currently has in development. “There’s a lot we can learn from Rivian’s clean sheet approach,” said Ford President Joe Hinrichs.

Next up in the electric car maker's pipeline: electric leaf blowers. On Tuesday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk says his company is planning to ""develop a quiet, electric leaf blower,"" and like all good Tesla declarations, the news came via Twitter. Musk sent a follow-up tweet with a pun. ""Tesla blows,"" the CEO said. P.S. electric leaf blowers already exist. But a Tesla version of the silent petal-blowing contraption may actually happen. Tesla plans: Can robotaxis help Tesla owners make $30,000 a year? What's a frunk?  Electric cars like Rivian, Tesla, Jaguar offer unique storage spaces Musk says the company may already have the parts to build it. ""We can probably just repurpose Model 3 HVAC parts,"" he tweeted. ""Not a big deal."" It's unclear if the leaf blower would be a whole new product line for Tesla or a limited run offering. Musk claims the idea was suggested by people inside and outside of the Palo Alto-based company. He also tweeted that the device will recharge quickly and have a long lasting battery. A few years ago, Musk founded another non-automotive project The Boring Company after reportedly getting stuck in traffic. ""Traffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging..."" Musk Tweeted. The Boring Company produced the viral limited-edition ""not a flamethrower"" flamethrower, which quickly sold out. The devices were priced at $500 each. Want a flamethrower?: Check eBay. It's not clear what prompted Tuesday's announcement.

Data from the financial-analytics firm S3 Partners indicates that as of Tuesday's close, short bets against Tesla, or bets that its stock would decline, were at their highest level of the year. At $8.9 billion, the stock is the largest automotive short worldwide, the firm said. Tesla's stock has fallen nearly 15% this year as store closings, a disappointing first-quarter deliveries report, and fears about the company's ongoing financial stability weigh on investors' minds.

According to S3 Partners' data, short investors seemed particularly energized by CEO Elon Musk's announcement at the end of February that he expected Tesla to slip into the red in the first quarter of this year. Tesla stock's 3.6% decline since Monday alone has made short-sellers $334 million in profits, according to S3, and the investors stand to make even more if Wednesday's earnings report matches investors' fears. ""We should see short sellers topping off their bets tomorrow, if they feel TSLA will report a quarterly loss following a delivery shortfall in its first quarter,"" Ihor Dusaniwsky, a managing director of predictive analytics at S3, said Tuesday. Tesla is the most popular short target not only for professional investors but also amateur traders who can mimic their directional bets through options contracts on retail brokerages. On Twitter, an army of Tesla skeptics who call themselves $TSLAQ has gained a massive following in recent months, much to Musk's chagrin.

One strategist said it should get even worse for the electric car maker. ""This is a company that has a cult following – people that believe that [Elon Musk] is changing the world – and that's the only reason this stock is trading at $260. There is no company that's better at overpromising and under-delivering than Tesla, "" said Mark Tepper, founder and president of Strategic Wealth Partners, on CNBC's ""Trading Nation "" on Tuesday. Tepper said its true valuation should be even lower. ""If I were to believe Tesla's stories, with a 35% projected earnings growth rate, even at a PEG [price/earnings to growth] ratio that's at a premium to the market, you still can't value the stock at over $100 a share and $100 is on the very high end,"" he said. Tesla has not traded below $100 since mid-2013. It would need to drop 62% to reach that level. A storm of headwinds are coming for the company, which could shake the stock, Tepper said. He mentioned an expiring tax credit, which could hurt demand, and increased competition, which means the company is jockeying for customers over price as well as quality. ""Quite frankly my biggest issue is management doesn't execute on what they say. I don't need management selling me a bill of goods. I want execution and you're not getting that from Tesla,"" said Tepper. Tesla has not responded to a request for comment. Following earnings, Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies, said the company needs to hold one key level to prevent it from tumbling. ""There's a very strong support level right around $250 for Tesla so we really want to see that level hold to preserve the long-term neutral bias of the chart,"" Stockton said Tuesday on ""Trading Nation."" ""The latest down move that we've seen has been significant. It has marked underperformance. It's very rare right now to see in the marketplace a stock that actually topped last December and this is one of those few, but we need some stabilization near support to get convinced that we have a basing phase in place for Tesla.""

""The options market is implying about an 8.5% move in either direction, or about $22 or $23. On average, over the last eight quarters, the stock has moved about 8%,"" said ""Options Action"" trader Dan Nathan. As far as which direction the stock could head, Nathan noted that bearish bets on Tuesday outpaced bullish bets by about 50%. ""There was one trade in this name — which doesn't normally see large block trades — that really caught my eye,"" Nathan said. ""Looking out to August expiration, when the stock was trading at $263.60, there was a buyer of 2,200 of the August 220-110 put spreads, paying $13 for that."" As Nathan explained, this is a phenomenally bearish bet that stands to net this trader about $21 million if Tesla plummets all the way down to that $110 price. Of course, to max out the profits on this trade, the trader is targeting a 58% drop in Tesla's share price between now and August. However, this monster plunge may not be as unlikely as it would appear at first glance. ""[Tesla] has been bouncing off this level of support a couple of times over the past year and a half or so. The thing is, there is a lot of tension down at that $260 level,"" said Nathan. If Tesla breaks through that key support level, there could be quite a long way to go before it finds another. ""Since [Tesla's] IPO in 2010, we know that [$260] is the support here, but we also know that this was long-term support down in that $150 area for years and years,"" said Nathan.

Electrek first reported on April 15 that Tesla had started delivering the $35,000 Model 3, known as the standard-range trim. The beginning of standard-range Model 3 deliveries is a landmark for Tesla, but the electric-car maker has been unusually quiet about it. While Tesla posted on its website and social-media accounts when it began allowing customers to order the standard-range trim in February, the company has mentioned the beginning of deliveries only near the bottom of an April 11 blog post about an update to its product offerings. Read more: Tesla announced improved battery ranges for the Model S and Model X and brought back the lower-cost version of both cars Tesla's low-key approach to the milestone is surprising, as CEO Elon Musk in a 2006 blog post described one of the company's primary, long-term goals as using the proceeds from high-end electric cars to fund the development of affordable models. Musk would later frame the Model 3 as the fulfillment of that goal and a turning point for Tesla from a luxury automaker to a mass-market one. The hundreds of thousands of preorders Tesla received for the Model 3 suggested demand for electric vehicles extended beyond early adopters willing to pay luxury prices. Tesla began delivering high-end versions of the Model 3 in July 2017 but struggled to hit production targets for the next year amid excessive automation at its Fremont, California, assembly plant. As the company smoothed out its production process, Musk said it needed more time to make the standard-range Model 3 profitably. In February, the company began allowing customers to order the standard-range Model 3, but less than two months later it removed the standard-range trim from its online-order page, saying customers could order it only by phone or in one of the company's stores. Tesla said demand for the standard-range trim was much lower than that for the standard-range-plus trim, which starts at $39,500, and said removing the standard-range trim from the online menu would increase efficiency and lower costs. The company also said standard-range customers would receive standard-range-plus Model 3s with software that would reduce their range and restrict some capabilities. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its communication strategy for the beginning of standard-range Model 3 deliveries. Have you worked for Tesla?

Or you can call it foolhardiness, if you like. The timeline Tesla set out to get fully self-driving cars on the road is aggressive. The company announced at an investor conference in Palo Alto Monday that it's ready to turn on fully autonomous capability in all of its cars by some time next year. It then plans to roll out an automated taxi service that would allow Tesla owners to rent out their cars for rides while they aren't using them. Cruise, a San Francisco company funded by General Motors and Honda, has said it will have self-driving taxis on the road by the end of this year, but often hedges that they will be ""gated by safety."" The service will initially operate in limited markets, presumably San Francisco, and may still have trained safety drivers sitting ready at the wheel, at least at first. Waymo has already begun giving taxi rides in Arizona, but only to preselected riders and, again, with trained drivers behind the wheel. Those drivers are taught to monitor what's happening and to be ready to slam on the brakes or grab the steering wheel as needed. Tesla, on the other hand, is getting ready to simply release its self-driving cars into customers hands. In most places, a driver will legally be required to be at the controls but this will likely be the owner, not someone specifically paid and trained to monitor the operation of a self-driving vehicle. Tesla forecasts that owners who make their cars robo-taxis could make $30,000 a year, offsetting much of the cost of the car. ""It's basically crazy to buy any other car than a Tesla,"" Musk said. There are reasons behind Musk's bold predictions, things that, he says, put Tesla ahead of other companies making self-driving technology. First of all, the company claims it has ""the best chip in the world"" for making and double checking driving decisions continuously in real time. (Chip maker Nvidia has contested this claim.) Musk also noted that most of Tesla's customers are out on the road every day driving mile after mile while, in the background, testing Tesla's self-driving software. There's little need for running software simulations -- Musk calls that ""grading your own homework"" -- because Tesla has so many real-world tests going on all the time, he said. The idea that a Tesla has all the technology it needs to enable self-driving may be surprising if you take even a casual look at a Tesla and compare it to the self-driving cars Waymo and Cruise are testing. The Tesla car hasn't got any weird looking stuff on the roof, for example. Those lumpy things are called lidar scanners and Tesla cars don't have them at all. Lidar is like radar but uses laser light instead of radio waves. Musk claims he doesn't ""super hate"" lidar, but everything else he says about the technology indicates that, actually, he really super hates it, at least for cars. ""Lidar is lame,"" he said, calling it expensive and pointless. Cameras, radar and sonar -- like radar but with sound waves -- are sufficient and far cheaper. Other companies also use those technologies but lidar, as well. Musk predicted that companies currently relying on lidar would dump it after a while. Others in the field differ strongly. For example, Srini Gowda, director of autonomous driving for the Chinese electric car maker Byton, called lidar absolutely necessary because of its unmatched three-dimensional acuity. Nothing else can detect where an object is and see what it is as well, he said in an email to CNN. The thing that makes Tesla stand out most though, is the utter lack of hedging. While other autonomous car makers are dialing back expectations, Musk and Tesla are dialing them up. There's no cautious tone. No ""gated by safety"" here. Presumably that's because Musk and Tesla actually believe their technology is at least substantially safer than unaided human drivers. Tesla and Musk have already made such claims about the company's Autopilot driver assistance technology saying that, despite a few headline making incidents, Autopilot users have fewer crashes, overall, than those who don't use it. There will, of course, be regulatory issues to overcome while rolling all this out but that seemed to be the one limitation Musk allowed. Well that and Tesla's well-known tendency to simply miss deadlines all on its own, something even Musk, himself, admitted. But, late or not, Tesla does also have a tendency to actually do things it says it will do sooner or later.

We know this occurred. We saw it with our very own eyes. But four days later something strange happened. On Tuesday, Elon Musk tweeted at his 26 million followers to announce that ""Tesla is going to develop a quiet, electric leafblower."" Sound familiar? It should! Musk used the exact same phrasing as the former star of The Office did in his request, yet failed to credit Wilson for the idea. Hmmm... Thanks to some helpful snitch tagging by Twitter user @AlvaroLuken, Wilson saw Musk's leaf blower tweet and decided to call out the Tesla CEO. After Musk claimed the idea of a ""quiet, electric leaf blower"" has been ""suggested by many, externally & internally,"" Wilson posted a screenshot of  the tweets and responded, ""C'mon Musk, give me some credit."" The interaction didn't stop there. This time, Musk directly replied to the man we know as Dwight K. Schrute and confirmed he had absolutely no intention of giving him credit for the leaf blower idea. To quote, Musk, a 47-year-old man, said, ""Nope 😜"". Many people seemed confused by the leaf blower tweet, and wondered why the man who has made a literal flame thrower and launched rockets into space would start focusing his energy on lawn maintenance. Taking everything we know about Musk's online presence into consideration, it seems extremely likely that he's trolling Wilson. Musk is a huge fan of memes after all, and he's no stranger to Twitter jokes and other ""nonsense."" So perhaps Wilson is simply his latest target. Maybe Musk is a huge fan of The Office. Who knows! It's been 0 days since Musk's last nonsense, but if Tesla does end up making a quiet, electric leaf blower, we all know Wilson is the real mastermind.",rainn wilson called elon musk tesla leaf blower idea,fact april actor rainn wilson tweeted elon musk asked tech leader could try create quiet electric leaf blower know occurred saw eyes four days later something strange happened tuesday elon musk tweeted million followers announce tesla going develop quiet electric leafblower sound familiar musk used exact phrasing former star office request yet failed credit wilson idea hmmm thanks helpful snitch tagging twitter user alvaroluken wilson saw musk leaf blower tweet decided call tesla ceo musk claimed idea quiet electric leaf blower suggested many externally internally wilson posted screenshot tweets responded musk give credit interaction stop time musk directly replied man know dwight schrute confirmed absolutely intention giving credit leaf blower idea quote musk man said nope many people seemed confused leaf blower tweet wondered man made literal flame thrower launched rockets space would start focusing energy lawn maintenance taking everything know musk online presence consideration seems extremely likely trolling wilson musk huge fan memes stranger twitter jokes nonsense perhaps wilson simply latest target maybe musk huge fan office knows days since musk last nonsense tesla end making quiet electric leaf blower know wilson real mastermind

That could help attract new buyers after the company reported a sales slump. Newly built ""Long Range"" versions of the Model S sedan and Model X SUV, which both start around $90,000 before savings, will be able to travel 370 miles and 325 miles, respectively, without stopping for a battery charge. That's about a 10% boost. The cars will get some hardware updates that will also improve ""acceleration, and ride comfort,"" Tesla (TSLA) said in a blog post. The upgrades could help lure customers to Tesla's more expensive offerings now that the cheaper Model 3, which starts around $35,000, is on the market, said Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. ""It's a way to keep those vehicles relevant,"" Brauer told CNN Business. ""And since the Model S and Model X have been in production longer, they probably have a lot higher profit margins built in"" — which means Tesla is probably eager to sell more of them. Tesla earlier this month reported a large drop off in sales of its luxury models. Even sales of the Model 3, which has enjoyed broad popularity since its debut, were on the decline. A large portion of the apparent slowdown in Model 3 sales could be attributed to logistics. The company has had trouble sorting out its system to ship cars abroad, and Brauer said the sales figures ""will smooth out over time."" But Tesla has ""a lot of things working against them"" right now, Brauer said. A $7,500 federal tax credit was cut in half for all Tesla models at the beginning of the year. It will be cut in half again this summer. That essentially made all Tesla cars more expensive for American consumers. Its competitors, meanwhile will still be able to use the full $7,500 tax credit until they sell their 200,000th electric vehicle. And there are a few long-range electric vehicles about the enter the market that could give Tesla meaningful competition for the first time in the company's history, Brauer said. Brands like Porsche, Audi, Mercedes are all planning to make EVs that could compete directly with the Model S and X. Meanwhile Hyundai's Kona electric SUV, which starts at about $37,000, could take a chunk of the Model 3's market. Tesla will report its first-quarter earnings results later Wednesday. After back-to-back quarters in which Tesla posted a profit, the company is expected to be back in the red.

The company said on Wednesday that it lost $702 million in the first quarter, a sharp reversal from the profits it made in the second half of last year. The loss, equivalent to $4.10 per share, was far greater than the $1.81 per share that Wall Street analysts, surveyed by FactSet, had forecast. The quarter’s revenue of $4.54 billion fell well short of expectations. Tesla had $2.2 billion of cash at the end of the first quarter, a 40 percent decline from the figure at the end of last year. The company spent $920 million paying off a bond in March. Tesla’s operations consumed $640 million of cash in the first quarter. Investors had been bracing for the red ink after Tesla said it sold 31 percent fewer vehicles in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter of 2018. The company said logistical challenges had hindered deliveries of the Model 3 sedan to Europe and China. A reduction in a federal tax benefit for Tesla’s buyers may have weighed on Model 3 sales in the United States. Another weak spot for the company was its solar business, where sales dropped by more than 35 percent in the quarter. “We expected weak results, but Tesla’s revenue and profit misses were stunning,” Vicki Bryan, chief executive of Bond Angle, a research firm, said in an email. “Revenue was soft, but spiking costs for obvious strategy missteps really drew blood at the bottom line.” The big question for Tesla is whether the drop in car sales in the first quarter was a temporary phenomenon or something more serious. Sales of Model 3 sedans could recover as the company delivers cars overseas. But demand for the higher-priced Model S and Model X vehicles plunged 56 percent in the first quarter from the fourth, even though the company cut the price of the cars at the end of February. Tesla said on Wednesday that the reduction in the tax credit might have weakened demand for the Model X and the Model S. The company added that after the price cut, the increase in orders for high-end versions of those models exceeded the available supply. Tesla is also hoping that buyers flock to new versions of the S and X that can travel farther on a full charge. In an investor call after the results were announced, a stock analyst asked why Tesla was cutting prices if demand was strong for its products. Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, responded that the goal was to make its cars “as affordable as possible.” Analysts had slashed their earnings estimates in recent weeks, and after the anemic delivery numbers, Tesla again faces doubts that it can achieve its goals and meet Wall Street’s financial targets. Its stock was little changed in extended trading after the earnings announcement, but it is down over 30 percent from its most recent high. Tesla said Wednesday that it expected to deliver 90,000 to 100,000 cars in the second quarter, up from 63,000 in the first three months of the year. It said it would lose money again in the second quarter, though less than in the first quarter, and would turn a profit in the third quarter. Tesla’s supporters are hoping that Model 3 sales will surge and enable the company to meet its target of delivering 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles this year. Tesla affirmed that goal on Wednesday, but said its vehicle production would be “significantly higher than deliveries,” because of the time it takes to transport cars from California to other countries. The company is now offering a $35,000 version of Model 3. The lower price may stir up demand for the car, but charging less could make it harder for Tesla to make a profit on the vehicle. Tesla’s cash position is crucial to the company’s future. Mr. Musk intends to produce new vehicles in volume, including a large truck called the Semi, but setting up the new production facilities would consume large amounts of cash. Many analysts expect that Tesla will have to issue new shares to raise money. Mr. Musk, who had previously said the company did not need more capital, indicated that he had changed his mind because Tesla was now in a position to use capital more efficiently. “There is merit to the idea of raising capital at this point,” he told analysts.",tesla quarterly loss bigger foreseen million,tesla surprisingly weak deliveries first quarter took heavy toll bottom line company said wednesday lost million first quarter sharp reversal profits made second half last year loss equivalent per share far greater per share wall street analysts surveyed factset forecast quarter revenue billion fell well short expectations tesla billion cash end first quarter percent decline figure end last year company spent million paying bond march tesla operations consumed million cash first quarter investors bracing red ink tesla said sold percent fewer vehicles first quarter fourth quarter company said logistical challenges hindered deliveries model sedan europe china reduction federal tax benefit tesla buyers may weighed model sales united states another weak spot company solar business sales dropped percent quarter expected weak results tesla revenue profit misses stunning vicki bryan chief executive bond angle research firm said email revenue soft spiking costs obvious strategy missteps really drew blood bottom big question tesla whether drop car sales first quarter temporary phenomenon something serious sales model sedans could recover company delivers cars overseas demand model model x vehicles plunged percent first quarter fourth even though company cut price cars end february tesla said wednesday reduction tax credit might weakened demand model x model company added price cut increase orders versions models exceeded available supply tesla also hoping buyers flock new versions x travel farther full charge investor call results announced stock analyst asked tesla cutting prices demand strong products tesla chief executive elon musk responded goal make cars affordable analysts slashed earnings estimates recent weeks anemic delivery numbers tesla faces doubts achieve goals meet wall street financial targets stock little changed extended trading earnings announcement percent recent high tesla said wednesday expected deliver cars second quarter first three months year said would lose money second quarter though less first quarter would turn profit third quarter tesla supporters hoping model sales surge enable company meet target delivering vehicles year tesla affirmed goal wednesday said vehicle production would significantly higher deliveries time takes transport cars california countries company offering version model lower price may stir demand car charging less could make harder tesla make profit vehicle tesla cash position crucial company future musk intends produce new vehicles volume including large truck called semi setting new production facilities would consume large amounts cash many analysts expect tesla issue new shares raise money musk previously said company need capital indicated changed mind tesla position use capital efficiently merit idea raising capital point told analysts

Big time. The electric car company said Wednesday that it lost $702 million last quarter. Its revenue was also down 37% compared to the prior quarter. Wall Street was already bracing for what one analyst called an ""apocalyptic"" quarter — but the results were still far worse than expected. While the company has posted big losses of this size before, analysts surveyed by Refinitiv predicted that Tesla (TSLA) would be about $301 million in the red for the quarter. The actual number was more than double that amount. Tesla stock dipped slightly after earnings were released, but later edged back to even. The company had posted back-to-back profits in the previous two quarters. Last quarter, for example, Tesla recorded a profit of $139 million on sales of $7.2 billion. There were a couple of reasons Tesla was so far in the red, according to Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader. First, a $7,500 federal tax credit was cut in half for Tesla vehicles at the beginning of the year. Then, brands like Porsche, Audi, Mercedes and Hyundai are all entering the electric vehicle market, giving Tesla meaningful competition for the first time in the company's history, Brauer said. ""None of these issues, by themselves, would cause the severe drop in sales and revenue Tesla experienced in Q1, but the combination was powerful,"" Brauer said in an email Wednesday evening. ""Even more troubling? None of these issues are going away. This is the new normal for Tesla."" CEO Elon Musk said during a conference call with investors that last quarter may have been rough, but Tesla has a rosy outlook. Demand for all three of Tesla's electric vehicle models is strong, he said. ""We also have a lot of markets [abroad] where we haven't yet tapped into demand, especially the Model 3,"" Musk said. Tesla revealed earlier this month that it delivered about 63,000 vehicles to customers in the first three months of 2019 — a 31% drop compared to the prior quarter, and the single largest decline Tesla has ever reported. The company said Wednesday that it expects its sales figures to look much better next quarter. The company has said it encountered ""many challenges"" ramping up deliveries of its vehicles abroad, but said those issues should be smoothed over soon and a major sales bump could be on the way. Slowing sales are bad news for Tesla because the company needs cash in order to pay down its sizable debts. Tesla said it ended last quarter with $2.2 billion of cash on hand, which the company had earlier described as ""sufficient."" Executives also said they expect cash stores to ""grow steadily"" in the months ahead. At one point on the call, Musk briefly alluded to a controversy that has dogged Tesla for the past several months. An analyst on Wednesday's earnings call referred to quarterly reports as a ""distraction"" that pulls people's attention away from Tesla's leadership and dominance in the electric car market. Musk laughed and said, obviously, he would ""prefer we were private."" The Tesla CEO has been in a standoff with the US Securities and Exchange Commission ever since he tweeted that he was ""considering"" taking the automotive company private last year, and that he had secured funding. The SEC said funding has not been secured, and has accused Musk of misleading investors.

Despite ""significant challenges with the battery module line at Gigafactory 1 in Nevada, and later with our general assembly line in Fremont"" Tesla managed to deliver nearly 140,000 Model 3 vehicles in 2018. That trend continued through Q1 2019 with the electric sedan outselling its nearest competitor by nearly 60 percent. ""To the best of my knowledge there were zero predictions that this would happen, that an electric vehicle would be the best selling car in the US,"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk told reporters during the company's earnings call. ""And we believe, eventually, the best selling EV car throughout the world."" The company expects its production for Model 3s to continue to grow thanks to its Fremont facility and expects a sustained capacity of 7,000 vehicles per week by the end of the year. The Gigafactory Shanghai plant is expected to reach its full production potential by the end of this year and boasts a capital spend per unit of capacity that's less than half of what we see at the Fremont facility's Model 3 line. ""That 50 percent, our internal forecasts are actually better than that,"" a Tesla executive noted during the call. ""We intend Model 3 to be the first step in a platform which we can cost effectively and quickly replicate across geographies and vehicle types,"" the earnings report reads. ""We have spent years developing this platform, and Gigafactory Shanghai and our planned Model Y production line will be the first to reap the benefits of this investment."" This added stock should help drive prices for the Model 3 even lower. ""It is critical that we continue this trend so that we can keep increasing the affordability of Model 3 while retaining a sustainable level of profitability,"" the Q1 financials read. ""The labor hours per Model 3 vehicle declined yet again by roughly 20 percent compared to Q3 and by about 65 percent in the second half of 2018 alone."" Tesla hopes to further improve efficiencies in its delivery system by leveraging its fleet of self-driving semis. North American Model S customers will also soon have the the opportunity to buy Tesla's in-house insurance. The program which has previously rolled out in Australia and Asia seeks to provide a lower-cost alternative to third party insurance for the S, which is among the most expensive electric vehicles on the market to insure. ""We are creating a Tesla insurance product,"" Musk confirmed during the call. ""We are hoping to launch that in about a month. We think it will be much more compelling than anything else out there."" Deliveries for the Model S and Model X fell sharply in Q1, hitting just 12,100 vehicles compared to the 2-year average of 25,000 units per quarter. The company cites seasonal downturns in demand as the driving cause of the shortfall. ""Nobody buys cars in winter,"" Musk quipped during the call, also noting that the two models did recently receive new longer range motors.

The program allowed customers to receive a new car if their car could not be fixed, among other benefits. It is unclear if InsureMyTesla is still available, as the former web link to the program was not active as of Wednesday afternoon. Tesla owners have dealt with high insurance costs due in part to the relative difficulty of finding replacement parts and qualified body shops. AAA raised insurance rates for Tesla vehicles in 2017, though Tesla argued that AAA's decision was ""severely flawed"" because it compared Tesla's Model S sedan and Model X SUV against dissimilar competitors.

The company lost $702 million in the first three months of the year and the EV maker doesn't expect to be profitable again until the second half of the year, according to first quarter earnings results reported Wednesday. Revenue was lower than expected at $4.5 billion. CEO Elon Musk had braced for a losing quarter back in February when he announced the $35,000 base price for the Model 3, but he still sounded disappointed on Wednesday's investor call to discuss the sluggish numbers. ""The brand is losing steam,"" Jessica Caldwell, executive director of industry analysis at Edmunds, said in an email. Still, Musk tried hard to pivot the call away from Tesla's losses and towards its robo-taxi masterplan. He envisions his proposed Tesla ride-hailing service powered by self-driving cars, which he discussed in detail at an investor event Monday, as a future boon for the car maker. He claimed again on Wednesday that he could get 1 million robo-taxis on the road by mid-2020 — pending regulatory approval, of course. Tesla would take 25 percent to 30 percent of each fare, and the rest would go to Tesla owners putting their cars out onto the network for rent. It will operate similarly to Uber or Lyft's ride-hailing app, but without the drivers. Currently Tesla vehicles have a semi-autonomous feature called Autopilot that can be added to the car, allowing it to auto-steer and change lanes, all while a driver remains at the wheel and attentive. But a new self-driving computer that will power the robo-taxis is 21 times better than Tesla's previous chip. It should be built into cars in at least three months. Musk noted how a full self-driving capable Model 3 for $38,000 would be more than a car purchase, but a money-making venture. With a self-driving fleet, he said, ""[Tesla] will have the most profitable taxi on the market."" He said it was ""financially insane to own anything other than a Tesla"" with its autonomous features. But it's tough out there for current willing Tesla buyers. Numerous customers are still waiting to get their ordered Model 3s. Tesla's first quarter ended with a rush to deliver its lower-priced all-electric sedan, a fact Musk lamented on the call. More than 10,000 cars were en route to customers before the quarter ended, and Model 3 deliveries were down 20 percent compared to the previous quarter with only about 50,000 of the cars delivered of the nearly 63,000 produced. Also brought up on the earnings call was a forthcoming Tesla insurance for all those robo-cars without a human driver and a pending decision on a production location for the future Model Y compact SUV. (It's between Tesla's California or Nevada factory.) Musk said an insurance product would be announced in about a month and would be ""much more compelling compared to anything else out there.""

The ostensible thesis of “Tesla Nation” is that other Serbs and Serbian-Americans have done great things in the United States, too. Throughout this documentary, an unconvincing actor named Jack Dimich recites excerpts from Tesla’s autobiography. There are also a few digressions that explain the history of major Serbian waves of immigration to America. But mostly, the movie, directed by Zeljko Mirkovic, consists of a barely organized series of interviews with notable Serbs and Serbian-Americans, and name-checks of others. Their ranks include scientists and engineers, writers and athletes. Some, like Karl Malden and Peter Bogdanovich, made their marks in Hollywood. Others, like Helen Delich Bentley of Maryland and George Voinovich of Ohio, served in Congress. It’s not surprising that there have been great Serbian contributions to the United States. But to whom is this film being addressed? The credits indicate that it is part of a project initiated by the Tesla Science Foundation, cryptically described on its website as “the most-active Tesla-related group in the world.” Based on interviews late in the movie, the goal of “Tesla Nation” is to present positive examples of Serbian entrepreneurs who are operating globally and to improve relations between the Serbian diaspora and Serbia itself. That it is showing in a movie theater — as opposed to a tourism bureau or a corporate training session — makes no sense whatsoever.",tesla nation review documentary celebrates accomplishments,nikola tesla serbian descent great things united states ostensible thesis tesla nation serbs done great things united states throughout documentary unconvincing actor named jack dimich recites excerpts tesla autobiography also digressions explain history major serbian waves immigration america mostly movie directed zeljko mirkovic consists barely organized series interviews notable serbs others ranks include scientists engineers writers athletes like karl malden peter bogdanovich made marks hollywood others like helen delich bentley maryland george voinovich ohio served congress surprising great serbian contributions united states film addressed credits indicate part project initiated tesla science foundation cryptically described website group based interviews late movie goal tesla nation present positive examples serbian entrepreneurs operating globally improve relations serbian diaspora serbia showing movie theater opposed tourism bureau corporate training session makes sense whatsoever

""When is the board going to wake up?"" asked Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean at the Yale School of Management. ""You know what they are? They do understand cruise control better than anybody else. The board is on 'cruise control.'"" Sonnenfeld's ""cruise control"" dig was referring to Tesla's innovative Autopilot feature and the company's touted self-driving vehicle efforts. Shares of Tesla were under pressure early Thursday after the company posted late Wednesday an adjusted loss of $2.90 per share for the first quarter. That was four times worse than Wall Street analysts had expected. Revenue was also below forecasts as demand for its electric cars waned. Sales of its vehicles rose 36% to $3.72 billion from $2.74 billion a year ago. But that was down 41% from the fourth quarter. To note, the company had warned earlier this month that first-quarter income would ""be negatively impacted"" because of ""lower than expected delivery volumes and several pricing adjustments."" And Musk cited on the post-Q1 conference call with analysts Wednesday evening that there were seasonality challenges — saying people don't like to buy cars in the winter. However, Sonnenfeld, with decades of experience studying CEO leadership and corporate governance, characterized Tesla's financial results as the ""worst disaster"" in the technology sector that ""a lot of us can remember in a long time."" It was especially bad for a company with a stock market value as large as Tesla, he added. Ahead of Thursday trading, Tesla's market cap was nearly $45 billion. It isn't that Musk has ""just dramatically failed in expectations but it's that he set these expectations himself,"" Sonnenfeld said. Tesla's stock is not ""anywhere near $420,"" he added, referring to the per-share price quoted in Musk's Aug. 7 tweet about taking the company private, which landed the CEO and Tesla in hot water with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sonnenfeld also scoffed at Musk's prediction at an event on Monday of some 1 million of the automaker's robotaxis, with no human drivers, hitting U.S. markets next year, calling such promises ""ludicrous.""

While the disappointing financials led to some downgrades and price target reductions, Nomura's Chris Eberle remains bullish. ""Management seemed confident in their near-term visibility, in particular, which is encouraging given that the second quarter is already nearly one-third complete,"" he said in a note to clients Thursday. ""Tesla also noted that it expects positive FCF in every remaining quarter in 2019, including 2Q, which we think is likely. Overall, we believe that Tesla's reiterated FY19 outlook is achievable, albeit challenging, and maintain our Neutral rating and $300 target price."" Earlier in the week, Tesla hosted an autonomy day for investors to show off its latest plans for self-driving, including a million-strong network of robo-taxis. However, the lack of details from executives led the firm Evercore ISI to downgrade its view and slash its price target for the stock by a hefty $90. Eberle says the demand fears cited by Evercore in its pullback are already addressed by Nomura delivery day. ""Data we have reviewed exiting March showed acceleration in Europe, particularly in markets in which Tesla has had only modest success in the past (Germany, France, Spain),"" he said. ""Furthermore, Model 3 gross margin declined only slightly QoQ, despite what we estimate was considerable ASP compression in the U.S."" Eberle's price target reflects a 16% increase from where shares of Tesla are set to open Thursday. His $300 valuation is just slightly above Wall Street's average price target, according to Bloomberg Data. Consensus targets have fallen drastically in recent months, down to $297 today. ""Over Tesla's history, step-function increases in the share price have coincided with steep increases in expected unit volumes, and Tesla's reiterated full-year outlook would qualify,"" Eberle said. ""In 2012, TSLA shares appreciated over 4 times, as sales expectations went from effectively zero to 100,000 per year. And in 2016, the stock gained again (approximately 90% from late-2016 to mid-2017) as investors began to conceptualize annual vehicle sales of 500,000 units.""

The RBS boss has resigned after five-and-a-half years in post saying it’s the “right time” for him to go. The announcement, made just prior to the bank’s AGM, was well timed, taking some of the sting out of the row over his £3.5m pay package, which voting advisor PIRC recommended investors oppose. McEwan, 61, often stated his desire to make RBS a “good safe bank” of which “people can be proud”. In terms of the former, it’s far safer than it once was. Shore Capital was quick out of the blocks with a note praising him for leaving it “in much better shape” than when he took on a job few wanted. The bank is turning a profit again after the best part of a decade in the red. It pays a dividend. Regulators no longer bite their finger nails at the mere mention of its name. McEwan was also able to see off most of the “legacy” issues it faced, overseeing the payment of a series of thumping fines for its involvement in scandals such as Libor interest rate and foreign exchange fixing, capped by a $4.9bn (£3.8bn) settlement with authorities in the US who were pursuing it for flogging dodgy mortgages in the run up to the financial crisis. Investors were denied the chance of seeing former boss Fred Goodwin on the witness stand when, on the eve of a court hearing over the controversial pre financial crisis rights issue, the bank blinked and offered an improved settlement. But while the Treasury has started to sell off the state’s stake in the institution, the shares remain well below what it would need to turn a profit on the money taxpayers pumped in to keep it afloat in 2008, and well below the high point they reached on McEwan's watch. It came on December 2014 when the stock closed above 400p. RBS now trades at around 150p below that. Then there is the question of whether the bank is an institution anyone can be “proud of”. That's perhaps the biggest knock on McEwan, the reason he departs with such a mixed legacy. It’s worth paying attention to the words of Ian Fraser, the author of the mightily impressive ‘Shredded’ covering the bank’s fall from grace, at this point. Fraser probably knows this institution better than any other outside observer and a new edition covering McEwan’s time in charge is coming soon. He says the bank has improved and credits McEwan with having made impressive strides towards normalising it. But significantly, he has concerns over the bank’s apparent culture, making particular note of the way it dealt with the scandal over the behaviour of the Global Restructuring Group for distressed business borrowers. “Cultural change is far from ubiquitous. The most glaring example was RBS’s refusal to acknowledge the extent of the wrongdoing that occurred inside GRG, or the harm the unit has done to thousands of business customers,” he says. Fraser says the new edition of Shredded will provide a number of examples of an apparent deeply problematic culture persisting at RBS. But its failure to spin off Williams & Glyn counts as another black mark. Billions were spent readying the business bank for divestment, which was the EU’s price for allowing the multi billion pound taxpayer bailout RBS received during the financial crisis. It failed, and an alternative plan to release funds to help challengers had to be hatched as a replacement.",ross mcewan leaves rbs mixed legacy,cheerio ross mcewan rbs boss resigned years post saying right time go announcement made prior bank agm well timed taking sting row pay package voting advisor pirc recommended investors oppose mcewan often stated desire make rbs good safe bank people proud terms former far safer shore capital quick blocks note praising leaving much better shape took job wanted bank turning profit best part decade red pays dividend regulators longer bite finger nails mere mention name mcewan also able see legacy issues faced overseeing payment series thumping fines involvement scandals libor interest rate foreign exchange fixing capped settlement authorities us pursuing flogging dodgy mortgages run financial crisis investors denied chance seeing former boss fred goodwin witness stand eve court hearing controversial pre financial crisis rights issue bank blinked offered improved settlement treasury started sell state stake institution shares remain well would need turn profit money taxpayers pumped keep afloat well high point reached watch came december stock closed rbs trades around question whether bank institution anyone proud perhaps biggest knock mcewan reason departs mixed legacy worth paying attention words ian fraser author mightily impressive shredded covering bank fall grace point fraser probably knows institution better outside observer new edition covering mcewan time charge coming soon says bank improved credits mcewan made impressive strides towards normalising significantly concerns bank apparent culture making particular note way dealt scandal behaviour global restructuring group distressed business borrowers cultural change far ubiquitous glaring example rbs refusal acknowledge extent wrongdoing occurred inside grg harm unit done thousands business customers says fraser says new edition shredded provide number examples apparent deeply problematic culture persisting rbs failure spin williams glyn counts another black mark billions spent readying business bank divestment eu price allowing multi billion pound taxpayer bailout rbs received financial crisis failed alternative plan release funds help challengers hatched replacement

Independent thinking, resiliency, and passion — and, apparently, not letting someone's upset feelings get in the way of achieving a vision. This was a lesson the hedge-fund billionaire Ray Dalio spotted after giving a one-hour personality test to top tech leaders such as Reed Hastings, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates, who all scored poorly in the ""concern for others"" category. The anecdote comes from Dalio's best-selling book ""Principles."" In 2011, Dalio was beginning a seven-year transition out of his founder-leader role at Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge-fund, with $150 billion in assets under management. He wrote that there was a vacuum left after his departure, which he called the ""Ray gap."" He was worried that his company would flounder without him. To find out exactly what was missing from Bridgewater in his absence, he sent out a test to other CEOs and company founders to find their defining qualities. The test closely followed the Bridgewater personality test that Dalio administers to potential new hires, which is in turn based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Dalio has previously told Business Insider, ""We look for people with a wide range of thinking types."" It may take all sorts to work in a company, but Dalio found that leaders aren't that different from one another. Dalio called these business giants ""shapers,"" or people who shape society. According to him, there are two types of shapers: managers and inventors. Managers take a great idea and perfect it without much creative thinking, while inventors push their vision without necessarily turning it into a business. For example, Albert Einstein was an inventor. Jack Welch (General Electric) is a manager. Bill Gates and Elon Musk are both, as was Steve Jobs. The test was given to the shapers Elon Musk (Tesla, SpaceX), Bill Gates (Microsoft), Jack Dorsey (Twitter), and Reed Hastings (Netflix). When they were faced with the choice between achieving their goals or pleasing others, they chose to achieve their goals every time. However, Dalio goes on to say that scoring low in this category doesn't mean what most people think. It means that, when given the choice of caring about pursuing a vision or upsetting someone, these leaders will choose to overlook upsetting someone to achieve whatever needs to be done. So they're not really heartless: They just won't let anything stand in their way, including some hurt feelings. Shapers did have some other qualities in common as well: the ability to pay attention to the big picture and the details at the same time, not letting anyone stand in the way of their goals, and having a flexible vision that changes in order to make things work better.",billionaire ray dalio asked bill gates elon musk reed hastings top leaders take personality test scored low one key area,take titan industry independent thinking resiliency passion apparently letting someone upset feelings get way achieving vision lesson billionaire ray dalio spotted giving personality test top tech leaders reed hastings elon musk bill gates scored poorly concern others category anecdote comes dalio book principles dalio beginning transition role bridgewater associates largest billion assets management wrote vacuum left departure called ray gap worried company would flounder without find exactly missing bridgewater absence sent test ceos company founders find defining qualities test closely followed bridgewater personality test dalio administers potential new hires turn based type indicator mbti dalio previously told business insider look people wide range thinking types may take sorts work company dalio found leaders different one another dalio called business giants shapers people shape society according two types shapers managers inventors managers take great idea perfect without much creative thinking inventors push vision without necessarily turning business example albert einstein inventor jack welch general electric manager bill gates elon musk steve jobs test given shapers elon musk tesla spacex bill gates microsoft jack dorsey twitter reed hastings netflix faced choice achieving goals pleasing others chose achieve goals every time however dalio goes say scoring low category mean people think means given choice caring pursuing vision upsetting someone leaders choose overlook upsetting someone achieve whatever needs done really heartless wo let anything stand way including hurt feelings shapers qualities common well ability pay attention big picture details time letting anyone stand way goals flexible vision changes order make things work better

By ""tech,"" I don't mean ""technology."" Major automakers are awash in technology and have been for more than a century. They aren't sitting around Detroit with great big hammers banging on rusty hunks of iron. Rather, I mean the software and the culture that pervades Silicon Valley, where billion-dollar businesses can be quickly built by companies with a dozen laptops, some Amazon server space, and cold brew on tap. Tesla has never really been in this industry. Instagram weighed literally nothing before it was acquired by Facebook. Tesla's first viable product, the original Roadster, tipped the scales at 3,000 pounds. Read more: The real reason Tesla is showing off its self-driving tech For years, a large number of Tesla bulls on Wall Street and boosters of the company elsewhere have been trying to jam the round peg of a carmaker into the square hole of a software firm (or a consumer-electronics enterprise, if you like the Apple analogy). Their argument, weak to begin with, collided headlong with reality on Wednesday when Tesla reported awful first-quarter earnings, losing about $700 million on greatly reduced revenue of about $4.5 billion (a huge dip from the previous quarter's more than $7 billion total). A Tesla store.
Spencer Platt/Getty Images The loss is easy to explain: Tesla built 63,000 Model 3 vehicles in the first quarter (the remaining production amounted to about 12,000 Model S and Model X cars), and because it operates a single assembly plant on the West Coast, it struggled mightily to get cars to customers, especially outside the US. Tesla is now the leading electric-car manufacturer on the planet, so this particular challenge should only get worse if demand holds up at current levels. Tesla's system of getting cars to its customers is its biggest liability right now. Financially, it resembles what happens when large automakers experience a sales collapse (when they also can't book deliveries). In 2005, for example, Ford notched a modest profit in the fourth quarter, but a year later, the No. 2 US automaker lost $6 billion — and more than $12 billion in 2006. The company didn't return to full-year profitability until 2010. Because the car business is staggeringly expensive to run, there needs to be some compensation to even attempt to be in it — and that's the equally staggering amount of cash that automakers see slosh through their operations. Cars are very expensive things. Tesla's sell for between $40,000 and $150,000. Hence the revenue surge in the second half of 2018 for Tesla. Of course, if you can't smoothly execute in this context — even absent an outside shock to sales — then when you lose money, you lose a lot of money. The leaders of big car companies know this and manage their businesses accordingly. Musk is starting to figure it out, and that's why he was quite subdued during Wednesday's earnings call with analysts after the crummy numbers were announced. He was a Ph.D. candidate in physics before he became the Thomas Edison of Silicon Valley — and the laws of physics say that if you can't move a 2 ton machine from California to Europe in a timely manner, you'll have to wait to get paid. Andy Kiersz/Business Insider In many ways, this situation highlights the bind that Tesla is in as a public company. We forget that Tesla raised just $226 million in its 2010 initial public offering, with its stock trading at about $20 for several years thereafter. In about a decade, Tesla has gone from being completely insignificant to being sort of important, selling about 250,000 vehicles last year. Its market capitalization, meanwhile, has surpassed Ford's and at times exceeded General Motors'. That obviously doesn't compute, but there is one useful takeaway: Tesla is chewing into the auto industry and making exceptional progress at proving the case for electric vehicles. But the more market share Tesla amasses, the more its economics are going to be car-company economics. I don't mean to diminish the company's software-powered technologies — on examination, what it's doing with full-self-driving tech is astonishing, as we learned during its autonomy-focused investor day this week. But clearly, logistics hell has now supplanted production hell as Tesla's biggest obstacle. Tesla can fix this, but it's going to take a while. Debugging the real world is time-consuming. On the plus side, car companies just like Tesla have been doing it for 100 years.",tesla enthusiasts analysts entering uncharted territory car maker never operated production expense levels tsla,nearly entire history tesla pegged tech company creation silicon valley firm headquartered tech mean technology major automakers awash technology century sitting around detroit great big hammers banging rusty hunks iron rather mean software culture pervades silicon valley businesses quickly built companies dozen laptops amazon server space cold brew tap tesla never really industry instagram weighed literally nothing acquired facebook tesla first viable product original roadster tipped scales pounds read real reason tesla showing tech years large number tesla bulls wall street boosters company elsewhere trying jam round peg carmaker square hole software firm enterprise like apple analogy argument weak begin collided headlong reality wednesday tesla reported awful earnings losing million greatly reduced revenue billion huge dip previous quarter billion total tesla store spencer images loss easy explain tesla built model vehicles first quarter remaining production amounted model model x cars operates single assembly plant west coast struggled mightily get cars customers especially outside us tesla leading manufacturer planet particular challenge get worse demand holds current levels tesla system getting cars customers biggest liability right financially resembles happens large automakers experience sales collapse also ca book deliveries example ford notched modest profit fourth quarter year later us automaker lost billion billion company return profitability car business staggeringly expensive run needs compensation even attempt equally staggering amount cash automakers see slosh operations cars expensive things tesla sell hence revenue surge second half tesla course ca smoothly execute context even absent outside shock sales lose money lose lot money leaders big car companies know manage businesses accordingly musk starting figure quite subdued wednesday earnings call analysts crummy numbers announced candidate physics became thomas edison silicon valley laws physics say ca move ton machine california europe timely manner wait get paid andy insider many ways situation highlights bind tesla public company forget tesla raised million initial public offering stock trading several years thereafter decade tesla gone completely insignificant sort important selling vehicles last year market capitalization meanwhile surpassed ford times exceeded general motors obviously compute one useful takeaway tesla chewing auto industry making exceptional progress proving case electric vehicles market share tesla amasses economics going economics mean diminish company technologies examination tech astonishing learned investor day week clearly logistics hell supplanted production hell tesla biggest obstacle tesla fix going take debugging real world plus side car companies like tesla years

The vehicles will be able to drive anywhere without any restrictions, Musk said during an event for investors, a feat no company has achieved. (Though Musk acknowledged that the company may not receive immediate regulatory approval to use the cars in an autonomous taxi service in some areas.) Waymo, currently seen by many experts as the leader in the autonomous-driving industry, started the first commercial, autonomous ride-hailing service in Arizona in 2018, but the service only covers a roughly 100-mile radius, and each vehicle features a safety driver who can take over when necessary. Read more: Tesla has achieved one of its biggest goals by delivering the long-awaited $35,000 Model 3 — but the company has been oddly quiet about it It's unlikely Tesla will meet Musk's prediction, said Mary Cummings, a professor at Duke who researches autonomous-vehicle technology. ""This is a publicity stunt to take away attention from the quarterly earnings,"" Cummings told Business Insider before the company announced its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Unlike nearly all of its competitors in the autonomous-driving industry, Tesla does not use lidar — which emits pulses of light to detect nearby objects — in its hardware suite. Musk has called the technology a ""crutch,"" and said on Monday that companies who use it now will eventually abandon it. ""Anyone relying on lidar is doomed,"" he said. ""They're all going to dump lidar. That's my prediction. Mark my words,"" he later added. Tesla instead relies only on cameras, radar, and ultrasonic sensors. But cameras and radar have limitations, Cummings said. ""Computer vision is an incredibly brittle technology,"" she said, and radar has trouble detecting objects that are stationary or moving perpendicular to a vehicle, an apparent issue that has featured in some high-profile Tesla crashes featuring Autopilot, the company's semi-autonomous, driver-assistance system. Lidar helps compensate for those weaknesses. ""That's why you need lidar, because you cannot get around the physics of the limitations of the radar that he's got ... unless he's some kind of new Einstein and they've been sitting on some kind of new radar breakthrough that no one in the history of the planet has ever done,"" an unlikely scenario, Cummings said. A Tesla representative pointed to comments made by Andrej Karpathy, the company's senior director of artificial intelligence, during Monday's investor event. During the event, Karpathy said cameras provide more detailed information to an autonomous-driving system than lidar does. ""Lidar is really a shortcut,"" he said. ""It side-steps the fundamental problems, the important problem of visual recognition that is necessary for autonomy."" Have you worked for Tesla? Do you have a story to share?

The average refund was $55 lower than a year ago after the final week of filing season, the Internal Revenue Service said Thursday. The average refund was $2,725, down 2% from $2,780 over the same period last year. But more people got refunds, with the IRS issuing 95.7 million, up from 95.4 million a year ago. The IRS has processed 130.8 million returns, up 0.2% from last year. It has received 137.2 million returns, also up 0.2%. The IRS has said it expects to receive 150 million returns for the year. This marks the first filing season since the Tax Cut and Jobs Act took effect. Experts have said the law should cut taxes for about 80% of Americans. But those who didn’t change their paycheck withholding during the year likely saw much of the tax savings in their checks, reducing or eliminating refunds and possibly even causing some people to owe money.

The paper, published Thursday in the Lancet, found that people taking oral immunotherapy -- microdoses of peanut allergen meant to partly desensitize patients over time -- paradoxically had three times the rate of anaphylaxis compared with those taking a placebo. That risk jumped from 7.1% to 22.2%, based on an analysis of more than 1,000 patients across 12 trials. There were no deaths in any of the trials. Those taking the treatment also reported more epinephrine use and saw roughly double the rate of other kinds of allergic reactions, the study showed. These findings were attributable to the treatment itself, not accidental exposures to foods, according to the authors. ""There have been so many studies coming out about oral immunotherapy for peanut, there's sometimes conflicting information out there about its effectiveness and reliability,"" said study author and internal medicine physician Dr. Derek Chu, now a final-year fellow in clinical immunology and allergy at McMaster University in Ontario. Oral immunotherapy has shown promising results in some trials, but Chu said there may be a disconnect between how researchers measure outcomes in the controlled environment of a research study, versus what happens in the real world. In clinical trials, researchers often rely on tests like an ""exit food challenge,"" in which patients eat a small amount of peanut under a doctor's supervision. Food allergies, however, are not so predictable. Some patients had allergic reactions to doses of the therapy they'd previously tolerated, the new study says. ""This protection that you get from going through immunotherapy -- that can change every day,"" Chu said. ""If you exercise within two to four hours, or you take a hot shower, or you have an empty stomach, that can all change the way your body interacts with the food that you've supposedly been desensitized to. ""So you can actually have an unpredictable reaction to the thing that's supposed to protect you."" Peanut allergy, along with tree nut allergy, affects an estimated 3 million Americans or more. Experts say its prevalence is on the rise -- and in the majority of cases, it's lifelong. ""We don't have any [approved] treatment for food allergy,"" said Dr. Alkis Togias, branch chief of allergy, asthma, and airway biology at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Togias was not involved in the new paper. ""From our perspective as an agency that is responsible for research in the field, what it tells us is that we need to improve on the methods for treating food allergy, especially peanut allergy,"" he said. Hope vs. hype People with peanut allergies, as well as parents of kids with these allergies, have been holding out for a treatment that can offer some peace of mind. The idea behind oral immunotherapy is not necessarily to eliminate the allergy completely but to reduce the likelihood that accidental contact with peanuts could become serious or deadly. A study published in November, for example, found that two-thirds of its young patients were able to eat the equivalent of two peanuts with no severe reaction after a months-long regimen of powder-filled capsules. In the wake of studies like that one, Chu's analysis may be a wake-up call -- but it doesn't mean all hope is lost. Researchers are already looking for ways around the risks, he said. ""Like the Tesla autopilot, for example, the first generation of any of these things was not perfect,"" said Chu, who carries an EpiPen for his own peanut allergy. Togias said there are a number of potential avenues for modifying how we approach oral immunotherapy, including changing the dose and taking it in combination with other medications, such as those that prevent allergic reactions. ""The message is clear: We need to do better,"" Togias said. ""But this is a first step."" Even with additional risks, he added, patients might see a valuable trade-off: Some may want the option of taking such a treatment anyway because they can plan for an allergic reaction at home, while perhaps still offering a layer of security for peanut exposures that happen out-of-the-blue, away from home. ""That's an important piece that is very personal,"" said Togias. Experts say that more research is needed in order to improve upon the experimental treatment, look at different ways of delivering the therapy and discover whether there are certain groups of patients who benefit more than others. ""There's hope that we will have something, but we have to separate hope from hype,"" Chu said. ""This is a first crack at a new treatment.""

The SEC in February sought to have Musk found in contempt of a fraud settlement last year after the CEO tweeted details about Tesla production numbers that were not vetted by the electric vehicle company's attorneys. Instead, U.S. District Court Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan ordered Musk and the SEC to try to resolve the dispute on their own. The parties have already requested one extension. The SEC sued Musk last year for making fraudulent statements after he tweeted on Aug. 7 that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The parties later settled and Musk agreed to step down as chairman and have the company's lawyers pre-approve written communications, including tweets with material information about the company.

To the delight of Tesla owners everywhere, the electric car company continually offers over-the-air software updates to the cars they already have, making it feel as if they are walking out to a brand new vehicle, instead of having to wait a year or so for a new, improved model. And now, CEO Elon Musk is talking about creating a fleet of Uber-like ""robotaxis"" with just such an upgrade. In March, with the introduction of the base $35,000 Model 3, a Tesla update made all existing Model 3s faster, practically overnight. Then in April, the Palo Alto-based company began rolling out its latest version of Navigate on Autopilot, which steers and navigates the car and negotiates traffic along a given path. This update gives drivers the option to allow their car to make lane changes on its own, without their having to confirm the suggestion. Prior to the update, drivers had to tap gear shift stalk to accept the lane-change suggestion before the car would shift lanes. Once the feature is toggled, whenever on the highway with a location plugged into the navigation bar, drivers can receive both visual and audio prompts that the car is about to switch lanes by itself. Drivers of cars built after August 2017 have the option of being notified through steering wheel vibrations. If you don't want to switch lanes, you can cancel the move by pressing the notification pop-up on the touchscreen or using the turn signal. No, this isn't a chance for you to take a nap while your car takes you to your destination. The autopiloting features work only if your hands are on the wheel. Dude, where's my car: Tesla ships 63,000 vehicles in Q1, missing expectations April Fools':Auto companies offer honey-powered car, futuristic camper & built-in pie oven The new settings are available to customers who have purchased Full Self-Driving Capability, which was previously called Enhanced Autopilot, installed via an over-the-air software update. Navigate on Autopilot joins a long list of useful driving modes that have been released over the years as the electric automaker heads toward fully autonomous driving, which CEO Elon Musk promised by the end of this year at an investor event on Monday. Summon: Tesla began rolling out an Autopilot feature called ""Enhanced Summon"" in 2019 to members of its early access program. It enables a Tesla vehicle to drive itself to the owner, say, in parking lots as long as the owner holds a finger on the button on their smartphone screen via the Tesla app. Currently, Summon allows you to navigate the car forward and backward slightly and slowly while touching the app screen from nearby. Stop Light Warning: This software update gives drivers a visual and audible warning signal when they are about to blow through a red light. This feature won’t apply the car’s brakes. Tesla's goal is to put a dent in the number of fatal traffic accidents that occur each year. Remote Heating: In December, Tesla released a new mobile app update that lets owners remotely activate their heated seat and steering wheel as well as schedule a service appointment. Track Mode: In November 2018, Telsa rolled out the update that lets drivers take better control of their vehicles. The update included optimized cooling, more powerful braking and the ability to drift Model 3 Performance cars. Ludicrous Acceleration Mode: This is the feature that enables a Model S sedan to go from 0 to 60 mph in under three seconds, which is faster than some Ferraris and Lamborghinis. Cold Weather: Some Model 3 owners complained in 2018 that cold weather made the door handles hard to pop out. Doors on the Model 3 are frameless so windows have to move slightly in order for the door to open. To correct this, Tesla pushed a software update in November. Navigate on Autopilot: This feature guides a car from a highway’s on-ramp to off-ramp. It’s designed to make finding and following the most efficient path to your destination even easier on the highway. However, self-driving technology came under scrutiny in early 2018 after an Uber car in self-driving mode struck and killed a woman crossing a street in Tempe, Arizona. What's a 'frunk'? Electric cars like Rivian, Tesla, Jaguar offer unique storage spaces  Obstacle-Aware Acceleration: This update automatically limits your car’s acceleration if an obstacle is detected in front of your vehicle while driving at low speeds. Valet Mode: This mode restricts access to your vehicle when handing it over to valet – hiding all personal data from your touchscreen, limiting maximum speed and performance your Tesla can achieve and locking your front trunk and glove compartment to safely conceal valuables. Software Version 9.0: This software update made Model S, Model X, and Model 3 smarter. Tesla introduced a refined and simplified user interface, along with entirely new features for the trio. Dashcam: This feature lets you record and store on a USB drive the video footage captured by your car’s side cameras in addition to the narrow forward camera. Competition: Tesla shares slide after Amazon invests in self-driving company, Aurora Sentry Mode: This security feature began rolling out in 2019 and adds a unique layer of protection to Tesla vehicles by continuously monitoring the environment around a car when it’s left unattended. You can set Sentry Mode before you leave the car or remotely from the app, and the car starts to record when someone or something gets too close. In Tesla fan groups, owners love to share video of close calls, lurking admirers and scared-off creepers. If the car shifts from the neutral standby state to its alarm state, the car alarm is activated, the center display gets bright and music plays at maximum volume from the car’s audio system. Owners get an alert and can download video of the incident, if they have a USB drive set up. Chill Mode: Moving away from the ever-increasing acceleration boosts, Telsa introduced Chill in 2017. It makes acceleration more gradual – ""ideal for smoother driving and a gentler ride for your passengers,"" according to Tesla. Dog Mode: No need for a well-meaning (or harshly worded) note on the hood, good samaritans, or to bust open the windows and dial 911. This feature, launched in 2019, is a fan favorite,designed to keep the car cabin at a comfortable temperature. It also displays the in-car temperature, an animated pooch and a message on the touchscreen so passersby will know a pet left inside is safe and sound. Lane Departure Avoidance and Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance: Tesla owners already have a Lane Departure Warning mode that causes the steering wheel to vibrate if they drift out of their lane without a turn signal on. These two modes (launched May 2), which work when Autopilot is not engaged, build on that. The new Lane Departure Avoidance Mode, when active, will keep the car in the lane and check to see if a driver's hands are on the wheel. If alerts do not get the driver to re-take the wheel and the car will slow down and turn the hazards on. Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance, which is automatically enabled but can be turned off for a single drive, steers the car back into the driving lane if there may be a collision or the care is near the edge of the road. Along with periodic software updates, Tesla tosses in a hidden gem or two, often referred to as ""Easter eggs."" These updates are sometimes discovered randomly by Tesla drivers. Other times, the company's CEO, Elon Musk, drops not so subtle hints on Twitter of what's to come. ""You have to love Tesla's sense of humor,"" said Elaine Borseth who drives a Tesla Model S. ""They've added Santa Mode around the holidays that turns your car into Santa's sleigh on the navigation. Oh, and there's the farting mode. They have all kinds of fun things that just make you smile."" Borseth, who's the vice president of the Electric Vehicle Association of San Diego, said that the over-the-air updates are the most exciting part of being a Tesla owner. ""It’s just great to be able to have a car that’s four years old, as mine is now, and have all the features of a new car,"" Borseth said. ""You get a notification. You go out to your car and you have new features."" Electric cars: Comedian Jay Leno says 'all modern cars are good,' but electric cars 'will be the future' Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX CEO releases rap song: 'RIP Harambe' Back to the Future: In February 2019, the company's mobile app got an update that allowed users to see a load of cheeky references to the famed film franchise. For example, the vehicle displayed on the app will turn into a Model X with its Falcon Wing doors opened – referencing Doc Brown’s DeLorean. Romance Mode: Video of a fire crackling in a fireplace starts to play on the car's center screen along with sensual music. This mode also turns on the car seat heaters. For obvious safety reasons, it works only when the car is in park. TeslATARI: Released in October 2018, this update included an emulator of classic 1980s games that are controlled either through the steering wheel or through the vehicles’ center touchscreens. And, no, Centipede hasn't gotten any easier over time. Fart Mode: A favorite among many younger Tesla passengers, this one's also known as Emissions Testing Mode. This feature includes a drop-down menu of, well, human emission sound options in all Tesla cars. You can also position the sound to come from any of the four corners of the cabin. So far, it's an odor-free and addictive experience. Santa Mode: This update gave Model S and Model X vehicle owners a reindeer icon within Tesla’s Easter Egg Menu around the holidays in 2017. Pressing the reindeer icon summoned Jolly Old St. Nick. Your turn signal sound becomes jingling bells. As Musk tweeted, this feature can also be triggered by saying ""Ho, ho, ho."" Holiday Show: In Dec. 2016, Model X owners received the ""Holiday Show"" update which delivered a synchronized light show with Falcon Wing doors. The update also added an overlay to the navigation that will make it look like you’re driving on the surface of Mars.   Fun Fact: The idea of Easter eggs started off with video games in the 1970s with the Atari 2600 in the game Adventure. It was a way for game designers to add a special fun touch that rewarded players for playing the game for leisure and not just to win. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is an avid video gamer.

The social network announced it had filed a lawsuit in a US federal court on Thursday, which alleges that a New Zealand company called Social Media Series Limited and three of its directors used different companies and websites to sell fake likes, views, and followers to Instagram users. This was done through websites that included SocialEnvy.co, IGFamous.net, and Likesocial.co, according to the suit. ""Through their business, Defendants [Social Media Series Limited and its directors] interfered and continue to interfere with Instagram's service, create an inauthentic experience for Instagram users, and attempt to fraudulently influence Instagram users for their own enrichment,"" the lawsuit said. It continued: ""Since July 2018, Defendants unjustly enriched themselves at the expense of Facebook and Instagram in the amount of approximately $9,430,000."" Facebook sent cease-and-desist letters to two of the company's directors in July and December 2018. Read more: Instagram will soon start cracking down on accounts that use third-party apps to dole out fake likes and followers According to the lawsuit, Instagram users who wanted to inflate their followers, views, and likes could pay for automatic likes via Social Media Series' various websites. Fake likes would then appear almost immediately after a customer posted a photograph to Instagram. The cost to the customer would depend on the number of likes being purchased, ranging from $10 to $99 per week, the lawsuit said. In its filing, Facebook gave examples of users who had gained 500 likes within seconds of posting something to Instagram. Facebook now has multiple lawsuits in the works relating to individuals or companies that sell fake engagement on its social media platforms. In March, it filed a lawsuit against f our companies and three people based in China, alleging that they had promoted the sale of fake accounts, likes, and followers on Facebook and Instagram. ""By filing the lawsuit, we hope to reinforce that this kind of fraudulent activity is not tolerated - and that we'll act forcefully to protect the integrity of our platform,"" Facebook's deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, wrote in a blog post at the time. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook.
Facebook In November 2018, Instagram said that it would also be targeting users who were paying for these fake likes. ""We've built machine learning tools to help identify accounts that use these services and remove the inauthentic activity. This type of behavior is bad for the community, and third-party apps that generate inauthentic likes, follows and comments violate our Community Guidelines and Terms of Use,"" it wrote in a blog post. The industry, in general, has been clamping down on what The New York Times dubbed as ""social media's black market."" The Times' reporting on this sparked an investigation into a company that was selling likes and followers to celebrities and businesses to boost their status online. The now-defunct Devumi LLC had more than 200,000 customers in its heyday, including reality television stars, professional athletes, comedians, TED speakers, pastors, and models, all of whom bought followers online. This case was settled in January. Twitter has also come under scrutiny for having fake accounts on its sites and has been taking steps to remove them.

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Hi, I’m Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here’s a look at the week’s tech news: On Easter, after terrorist attacks killed over 350 people, the Sri Lankan government blocked social media platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat. Harindra Dassanayake, a presidential adviser in Sri Lanka, said officials had acted out of fear that misinformation about the attacks and hate speech could spread, provoking more violence. Social media certainly deserves scrutiny for its role in violence and terror. My colleagues Amanda Taub and Max Fisher have explained how false rumors spread via Facebook in Sri Lanka previously led to mob violence and murder. Similar problems have been observed in Indonesia, India and Mexico. But there appears to be little evidence that blackouts are a correct response to an act of terrorism. A 2018 report by Human Rights Watch found that there was “no substantive data or evidence to prove that internet shutdowns can scale down violence.” Jan Rydzak, an associate director at Stanford’s Global Digital Policy Incubator, said that “governments of more than 40 countries have already used shutdowns as a tool to generally prevent or halt the spread of violence or riots, and not a single one has given us a report of success.” In fact, Mr. Rydzak has published research based on data from India showing that shutdowns correlated with an increase in violence as days passed. Also consider this: Blocking social media cuts the flow of useful information, too, preventing people from contacting loved ones or getting useful information — especially in countries, including Sri Lanka, where social media platforms have become primary forms of communication. “Imagine the day following 9/11 and what it would have been like without a communal response,” said Alp Toker, the executive director of the internet monitoring group NetBlocks. This brings me back to the contentious debate over the increasingly popular mandate from governments for better policing of harmful content on social media platforms. In these situations, the infringement of free speech, a concern often raised by critics of aggressive regulation, seems rather more palatable than total blackouts. Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, made bold predictions last Monday about the automaker’s autonomous driving abilities: that Tesla would offer fully autonomous driving by the middle of 2020, and run a fleet of robo-taxis in the United States by the end of the same year. He also said the vehicles would theoretically be able to drive anywhere, in all weather conditions. Mr. Musk is in a rush. The rest of the world may not comply. Here’s why. First: the driving. “It’s a really hard problem,” said Ingmar Posner, an associate professor of information engineering at Oxford University and a co-founder of the university’s autonomous-driving spinoff, Oxbotica. He, like many other commentators, is skeptical of Tesla’s ability to offer full autonomy so quickly, and said driving on unseen roads in all weathers remained a big challenge for autonomous vehicles. Second: society. Jack Stilgoe, a senior lecturer at University College London specializing in the governance of emerging technologies, pointed out that adoption could be hampered by concerns over unintended consequences of robo-taxis. The public also needs to be convinced that it wants to use the vehicles, and road users must learn how to interact with them. Then there are infrastructure and connectivity to build out. This all takes time. Finally: regulation. Mr. Musk conceded that his cars wouldn’t receive universal regulatory approval initially. But Mark Fagan, a lecturer in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, says Mr. Musk’s chutzpah — particularly the claim that future Teslas may allow drivers to dial up driving aggression to a point where there is a “slight chance of a fender bender” — could backfire. “If I were a regulator, I would find that troubling,” Mr. Fagan said. “I’d be burning the midnight oil to put a piece of regulation in place to protect the citizenry.” Chris Urmson, previously the technical lead on Google’s self-driving car effort and now chief executive of the autonomous car start-up Aurora, recently told The Verge that we would “see small-scale deployments in the next five years, and then it’s going to phase in over the next 30 to 50 years.” Those time scales would allow autonomous cars to be deployed safely and sustainably. But, Mr. Stilgoe said, “that’s inconvenient for technology developers who want an event horizon of years, not decades.” Facebook said Wednesday that it expected the Federal Trade Commission to fine it up to $5 billion for privacy violations. Is that enough? It would be a record penalty against a tech company by the F.T.C., far beyond the $22 million demanded of Google in 2012 for misleading statements about online tracking. It would also be in line with recent European Union punishments, like Google’s $5 billion antitrust fine last year and the $15.3 billion tax-evasion penalty given to Apple in 2016. And it looks good for the F.T.C. and Facebook: The regulator looks strong; the tech giant looks accountable, without remaking its business. But $5 billion is a fraction of Facebook’s $56 billion in annual revenue. And while this and any future single-digit billion-dollar fines would pile up, critics aren’t convinced. Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, the chairman of the House’s antitrust subcommittee, called it “a slap on the wrist.” Also troubling: The fine would stem from a consent decree made with the F.T.C. in 2011, in which Facebook promised to improve its privacy practices. Eight years later, Facebook’s technology has moved on, to unpoliced realms where the social network can now infer things about you without the need for as much explicit information. Like it or not, tech regulation is coming, and some threatens not just large fines but sweeping changes that could undermine Facebook’s business model, or even cleave the company. That could make $5 billion look small indeed. ■ Samsung delayed the sale of its folding-screen phone. Reports of broken review units caused the company to say devices need “further improvements.” ■ Scientists created speech from brain signals. A new prosthetic voice decodes what the brain intends to say and generates (mostly) understandable speech. ■ China exports its surveillance tech around the world. As far away as Ecuador, its software is being used to by the police and domestic intelligence to study camera footage. ■ Google employees say they suffered after organizing a walkout. Workers who rallied staff to protest the company’s treatment of sexual harassment said they had been demoted or told that their role would change. ■ Drones are taking off. Alphabet’s drone company, Wing, was granted the first approval for drone deliveries in the United States, and a start-up, Zipline, is using them to deliver medicine to 12 million people in Ghana. ■ Rural 5G will be disappointing. Verizon and T-Mobile both admitted that the superfast version of the new wireless standard would be limited to urban areas. Jamie Condliffe is editor of the DealBook newsletter.

Jon McNeill, Lyft's chief operating officer and former president of global sales and service, didn't go so far as to compare Musk to the great showman P.T. Barnum, but he did express plenty of doubt for the billionaire's plan. ""I just don't know if that's possible to do,"" McNeill said in an interview with Business Insider. ""What we spend our time thinking about is we've got a future that is driver-based."" Lyft, like Tesla and its major competitor Uber, is investing in self-driving cars, too. The company's autonomous shuttles have facilitated more than 35,000 rides in Las Vegas as part of Lyft's partnership with Aptiv, it said in its initial-public-offering (IPO) filings earlier this year. However, a wider rollout of that could be years away, and until then, the company is focused on its human drivers. ""What our research shows is that even with autonomy happening over the next few years — or starting to be deployed over the next few years — we'll need more drivers in five years than we have today,"" McNeill said. ""And we'll need more drivers in 10 years than we need in five years. So we're in the long-term driver business."" Lyft said it has barely scraped the surface of its potential market, which includes not just the hundreds of billions of car trips Americans take every year, but also people's trips on bikes, scooters, and public transit. Shifting all of those to autonomous vehicles won't happen overnight, McNeill said. ""If you add up the overall bookings of Uber and Lyft, let's say we're $30 to $35 billion dollars into that $1 trillion opportunity,"" he said. ""So over the next five to 10 years that $30 to $35 billion, or 1% of miles traveled today, grows into that trillion-dollar opportunity. And it grows faster actually, we believe, than the penetration of autonomy."" ""If autonomy is serving 5% of rides, you still need 95% of ride service by drivers,"" McNeill said.",lyft coo former tesla exec latest expert throw cold water elon musk plan million road lyft,plenty people skeptical elon musk vision million tesla streets next year even one former executives jon mcneill lyft chief operating officer former president global sales service go far compare musk great showman barnum express plenty doubt billionaire plan know possible mcneill said interview business insider spend time thinking got future lyft like tesla major competitor uber investing cars company autonomous shuttles facilitated rides las vegas part lyft partnership aptiv said ipo filings earlier year however wider rollout could years away company focused human drivers research shows even autonomy happening next years starting deployed next years need drivers five years today mcneill said need drivers years need five years driver business lyft said barely scraped surface potential market includes hundreds billions car trips americans take every year also people trips bikes scooters public transit shifting autonomous vehicles wo happen overnight mcneill said add overall bookings uber lyft let say billion dollars trillion opportunity said next five years billion miles traveled today grows opportunity grows faster actually believe penetration autonomy autonomy serving rides still need ride service drivers mcneill said

It broke out as a Tesla Model S was sitting in a parking garage. The car had not just suffered an impact, as in previous fire cases, and it was not charging. Thankfully, no one was hurt. The company is investigating the incident. In the world of Tesla, fires have become a battleground for the company's supporters and detractors. Supporters accuse the media of making too much of the sometimes grisly incidents. They point out that combustion-engine fires happen all the time without garnering any attention. Detractors accuse the company of not being open enough about the cause of the fires and why they sometimes occur even though a car has not appeared to have sustained any kind of impact. The debate has gotten so intense that CEO Elon Musk has joined the fray, tweeting in hopes of dispelling any notions that electric vehicles are more dangerous than cars with internal combustion engines.  Chris Brown of Aristides Capital, who tweets under the moniker @midwesthedgie and is short Tesla, responded to Musk by walking through the numbers using data from the National Fire Protection Association (where the most recent data available is from 2015). Brown broke it down like this: Tragically, that isn't what has been happening. Last month, a Davie, Florida, man died after his Tesla crashed into a tree and ignited. First responders were reportedly not able to open the car's extendable door handles. In December, a woman in New Hampshire died after her car ignited following a crash. Last May, two teenagers in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, died after the one driving a Tesla Model S crashed into a wall and the battery caught fire. And there's more. Business Insider has counted at least 20 reported incidents of Teslas catching on fire since 2013 and five deaths in the past 14 months. That is part of the reason these fires are getting so much attention. It's life, death, and math. Tesla took issue with this calculation, saying the occupants of these cars would have died when their cars crashed regardless of whether the cars caught fire. ""The calculation cited by Business Insider is highly misleading because it implies that each of the cited fatalities were caused by fire-related injuries, whereas most traffic fatalities — even ones where a crash results in a fire — are due to impact-related injuries caused by the initial crash,"" a Tesla representative said. ""Based on the evidence, in every such case we know of involving a Tesla vehicle, the occupant would have died whether the crash resulted in a fire or not. This analysis is also flawed in that it compares our powerful performance vehicles to the buses, motorcycles, and trucks that are included in US vehicle registration data."" If you have any experience working with electric vehicle fires (Tesla's or any other car's) email me at llopez@businessinsider.com. Most of these Tesla fires seem to be caused by the electric vehicle's battery suffering some kind of trauma, sometimes by crashing at high speeds. In the Davie incident, the driver was going between 75 mph and 90 mph on a road with a 50-mph speed limit. The two teens who died in Fort Lauderdale were going 116 mph. ""Whether it's Tesla fires, or BMW or Fisker, if you look at the ones that caught on fire, almost every single one of them was operating outside of agency testing parameters,"" the auto-extrication and fire-rescue expert Brock Archer told Business Insider over the phone. ""They were going too fast and ended up crashing."" But there have been a few fires, like the one in Shanghai, in which the battery did not appear to be damaged. These fires are strange even to those who have focused on preparing for an electric-vehicle revolution. ""There are really only a few reasons why a lithium-ion battery catches on fire,"" Archer said. ""Liquid, dead short,"" or, for every one battery cell in a billion, ""spontaneous combustion."" Every Tesla battery is made up of thousands of cells, which are configured into the modules that make up a battery pack. So while one out of every billion cells sounds like a lot, consider that Tesla's Gigafactory aims to make 3 million cells a day, and Elon Musk thinks that's not enough. He wants more. The arrival of lithium-ion batteries on the road is a unique challenge for rescue experts, who have ramped up efforts to teach first responders around the world the best practices for fighting lithium-ion-battery fires. We should note here that Archer said across the whole auto industry, electric vehicles catch fire at slightly lower rates than cars with internal combustion engines — and hybrids do so at much lower rates, as their high-voltage batteries are smaller — and that he said fighting an electric vehicle fire was no more difficult than fighting an internal-combustion-engine fire for those who know what they're doing. We should also note that he's worked closely with Tesla on firefighting in the past. A damaged battery cell — whether the damage has been done by some kind of impact, water damage, or manufacturing defect — can go into ""thermal runaway."" That's when the temperature in the cell rapidly increases and then triggers the same reaction in another cell and another one after that. That is called ""cellular propagation,"" and in some cases it manages to stop itself inside the battery. In other cases, though, you've got a fire on your hands.  Read more: Insiders describe a world of chaos and waste at Panasonic's massive battery-making operation for Tesla According to training videos being disseminated among first responders, firefighters cannot put out a lithium-ion-battery fire with foam or dry chemicals. These fires cannot be fought with anything but 500 to 8,000 gallons of water and patience. Responders should expect a longer commitment time to the fight than they would in a combustion-engine fire, and they should be mindful that the fire could reignite days after it seemed to be under control. That's what happened during another strange incident in Los Gatos, California, in December. The owner of a 2018 Tesla Model S with about 1,200 miles on the odometer took the car to a repair shop after getting a flat tire on the highway. While the owner was inside the repair shop, at about 2 p.m., the car suddenly ignited and firefighters were called. They used about 2,000 gallons of water to put the fire out. The car reignited at the shop at about 10 p.m. (This is why experts say any electric vehicle that has experienced a battery fire should be kept 50 feet from any objects for a few days.) A police report obtained by Business Insider could not determine the cause of the Los Gatos fire. Archer says the source of the fire is often so damaged that it's impossible to say what causes a battery to go into thermal runaway — whether it's triggered by something outside the battery or a defect inside the battery. To be fair, Tesla is not the only company that has dealt with stationary cars catching on fire. In 2017, BMW recalled a million cars with defective PCV valve heaters and blower motor system connectors after ABC did an investigation into mysterious fires starting in parked BMWs that would sometimes reignite days after being put out. ""At BMW, the safety of our customers is a top priority,"" a BMW spokesman, Hector Arellano-Belloc, said in a statement after the recall was announced. ""We understand the serious nature of a vehicle fire, which is why we are taking appropriate steps to repair our customers' vehicles."" Professionals burned a Tesla to demonstrate how to put out a vehicle fire involving a high-voltage battery.
North American Heavy Rescue Symposium, YouTube Archer stressed that a lot of outside factors could contribute to an electric-vehicle fire, such as damage to the battery or the car's state of charge. Most incidents, he said, occur when a car is fully charged or charging. And since a single defective cell can trigger thermal runaway, manufacturing glitches matter too. That is why, as Business Insider previously reported, an oil spill on the Panasonic operating side of Tesla's Gigafactory last September sent the factory scrambling. The spill was detected on September 17, according to internal documents viewed by Business Insider, but it's unclear exactly when it started. Mechanical oil got onto one of Panasonic's massive machines used to press battery chemicals into a sheet. The machine then contaminated any product it touched. Employees had to stop what they were doing and sift through millions of nearly finished battery cells to find products that might've been affected, sources said. They searched for cells dating back to September 11. Not all incidents are that dramatic, though. Sources also reported incidents of tools or scissors falling into the massive 16-foot-high mixers that churn lithium and other chemicals. Greg Less, the technical director of the University of Michigan Energy Institute's Battery Fabrication and Characterization User Facility, told Business Insider that if a piece of shrapnel — something as small as a millimeter or half a millimeter — got into the lithium mix, the battery cell could cause a hard short or even a fire. ""That's horrifying,"" he said. ""If you have something metal inside of your mixer and it's grinding around in your mixing jar, you're going to get shrapnel."" A Tesla representative said that the company conducted multiple tests on battery cells once they're received from Panasonic and that cells that didn't make the cut were sent back to Panasonic. ""Tesla vehicles achieved the lowest probability of injury of any vehicles ever tested by U.S. government [NCAP] safety rating program,"" Tesla said in a statement to Business Insider, ""and based on our fleet of over 500,000 electric cars, we know that a Tesla vehicle is approximately 10 times less likely to experience a fire than a gas car.""

Dalio heads Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund. In his 2017 bestseller, ""Principles,"" he wrote about a test based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator that was used to screen prospective employees at his hedge fund. Originally, the test was crafted for founders like Elon Musk (Tesla, SpaceX), Bill Gates (Microsoft), Jack Dorsey (Twitter), Reed Hastings (Netflix), and many others. When Dalio read the results for these tech moguls, he found that they had four things in common. Mental maps kept them all organized, Dalio wrote. ""They have very strong mental maps of how things should be done, and at the same time a willingness to test those mental maps in the world of reality."" The second thing they had in common was vision. Dalio said they could all ""see both big pictures and granular details (and levels in between) and synthesize the perspectives they gain at those different levels."" They're also incredibly resilient. Dalio said he thinks this was such a common trait because ""their need to achieve what they envision is stronger than the pain they experience as they struggle to achieve it."" But most importantly, according to Dalio, they have passion. ""They are passionate about what they are doing, intolerant of people who work for them who aren't excellent at what they do, and want to have a big, beneficial impact on the world,"" he said.

The city announced Friday that three of its parkades have added the charging stations at no cost to the city, thanks to the Tesla Charging Infrastructure Municipal Grant. Together with the six existing Level II charging stations that already exist in Calgary Parking Authority parkades, that means 48 charging stations are available for all plug-in electric vehicles, with both Tesla-specific or universal plugs. The charging stalls are installed at the Convention Centre parkade, McDougall parkade and City Hall parkade. ""We're excited to offer this service to our customers driving downtown in electric vehicles,"" said Glen Furtado, general manager of the Calgary Parking Authority. ""With dedicated parking stalls equipped with Level II charging stations, Calgarians can charge while they work."" Even better: People who use the charging stations only pay the regular parking rate. The program is part of Calgary's Climate Resiliency Strategy, which determined that electric vehicles represent the single largest opportunity to reduce transportation-created greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, said Eric MacNaughton, senior transportation engineer with the City of Calgary. The additional charging stations are part of a concerted effort to improve charging network access for electric vehicle owners. This includes a recent initiative launched by the Peaks to Prairies EV Charging Network and a federal $5,000 rebate for people purchasing certain types of electric vehicles.

Here are 8 he failed to deliver on. (TSLA),"Tesla CEO Elon Musk is a visionary. He's accelerated the rate of electric vehicle adoption across the world, while also exploring Mars and digging tunnels. But the billionaire also has a habit of over-promising and under-delivering. For Tesla skeptics, those ambitious targets that don't always get met on time are proof enough that Musk is a fraud. Yet for some of the company's staunchest supporters, the same execution is just proof he's a genius at work who can't be confined to traditional metrics. ""Sell-side analysts who don't know the guy, who don't understand the technology, who don't understand what it is like to work at Tesla — they translate his 'shot for the moon' as 'they missed it,'"" Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research, easily Tesla's biggest Wall Street bull for years, told Business Insider last year.

Ford shares rallied by close to 11% on Friday after its Thursday earnings report, while Tesla stock was dragged lower in the second half of the week after a Wednesday first-quarter earnings report that even Tesla bulls could not find any good news in. Tesla shares declined by 5% on Friday and are now down close to 30% in 2019. Ford's market cap was $41.5 billion on Friday at the close of trading, while Tesla's market cap dipped to $40.6 billion and at a low on Friday afternoon had been below the $40-billion mark. In April 2017 Tesla had risen above both Ford and GM to become the largest U.S. automaker by market cap, an event greeted with considerable headline attention. But concerns about slumping EV demand (especially in the U.S. as tax credits expire) and Tesla's dwindling cash on the balance sheet — which declined by $1.5 billion in the first quarter as it paid off debt and invested in the Model 3 — have continued to weigh on shares. In mid-April, about a week before Tesla reported, bearish bets against its stock represented roughly 27% of its publicly available shares, known as the float. Tesla has attracted prominent hedge fund shorts, including David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital and Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates. GM had taken back the market-cap crown from Tesla already and remains the largest of the three, with a stock market value of $56 billion. ""The ship is starting to turn after a lot of work on the fitness of the business, rethinking the product portfolio, working on a number of alliances,"" outgoing Ford CFO Bob Shanks told CNBC. Ford announced Wednesday it had invested $500 million in electric-truck maker Rivian to build a battery-powered electric vehicle, which Shanks said is a ""win-win"" for both companies. The reaction to Tesla earnings was widely negative. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a longtime Tesla bull, wrote on Thursday in removing his buy rating, that after ""years of covering tech stocks on the Street we view this quarter as one of top debacles we have ever seen while Musk & Co. in an episode out of the Twilight Zone act as if demand and profitability will magically return to the Tesla story."" Tesla's new CFO, Zachary Kirkhorn, said on its Wednesday earnings call that Q1 was ""one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in the history of the company and it was ambitious even by Tesla's standards."" Kirkhorn braced investors for another quarterly loss in Q2 but said the company should return to profitability in the second half of the year. Musk and Kirkhorn said on the call that they estimate sales of 360,000 to 400,000 cars this year, and Musk said the company has passed the worst of the U.S. tax credit impact on demand. Ford sold 591,000 vehicles in the U.S. in the first quarter, though mostly trucks (279,000) and SUVs (213,000). Car sales were roughly 98,000. Market cap is an arbitrary way to evaluate a company at any single moment in time, and Musk invoked Warren Buffett in reference to Tesla stock volatility on the earnings call: ""I think this feels like the sort of price of the stock is being set in kind of a manic-depressive way. And I think Warren Buffett's analogy is just like perhaps being a publicly traded company is like having someone stand at the edge of your home and then just randomly yell different prices for your house every day. It's still the same house."" Wall Street is not convinced that Tesla can turn things around quickly. A capital raise of as much as $3 billion also looms to shore up the balance sheet. Musk, contrary to past history, did not rule out raising more capital this year on the earnings call. ""I don't think raising capital should be a substitute for making the company operate more effectively ... We have made dramatic improvements across the board, and so I think there is merit to the idea of raising capital at this point,"" Musk said. A capital raise could pressure Tesla shares in the short term as current shareholders see their stock value diluted in a new equity offering, but longer term a stronger balance sheet could bring in new investors, Ives recently told CNBC.

The stock ended the brutal week down more than 12% after an investor day that focused on autonomy and failed to excite Wall Street analysts was followed by an earnings report that missed expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Markets Insider
One analyst, Daniel Ives of Wedbush, said he could no longer in good faith recommend the stock to clients. ""To this point, in our 20 years of covering tech stocks on the Street we view this quarter as one of top debacles we have ever seen while Musk & Co. in an episode out of the Twilight Zone act as if demand and profitability will magically return to the Tesla story,"" Ives and his fellow analyst Strecker Backe said in a note on Thursday. ""As such, we no longer can look investors in the eye and recommend buying this stock at current levels until Tesla starts to take its medicine and focus on reality around demand issues which is the core focus of investors,"" they added. Wall Street analysts polled by Bloomberg have an average price target of $296 for Tesla — about 26% higher than Friday's close. Twelve of those analysts recommend buying the stock, with nine rating it neutrally and 15 rating it a sell. ""We remain encouraged by Tesla's vision and future growth prospects (brand value, global Model 3 and Y TAM, Semi, etc.), but there is increased uncertainty around near-term demand vs previous bullish forecasts and growth cannot stall for a growth company,"" Evercore ISI analysts led by Arndt Ellinghorst wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

The software originates from an early 2000s project called Xbox Media Center (XBMC) that gave Xbox owners the ability to upload video, pictures, and play music on their game console. Today, the software is available on multiple platforms, including Windows, Android, and MacOS. The official version of Kodi does not contain any content — it's just a media player. You have to add your own media to the platform in order to watch or listen using Kodi. There are many add-ons available to enable playback from a variety of sources. Not all add-ons are supported by the official Kodi development team, so it's best to be cautious about the add-ons you choose to install. While you can't install Kodi on a Roku device, you can still access your Kodi content on Roku by screen mirroring another device onto a Roku player. You'll need to ready both devices for screen mirroring before you can use Kodi to play your content. Here's how you can use screen mirroring to use Kodi on Roku. Before you can mirror a device on your Roku, you must enable screen mirroring. 1. From the settings menu, scroll until you find ""System."" Click OK on your remote to open the System menu.

Reach a Settlement, Again","If it was not already clear, securities regulators are giving Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, a laundry list of things he cannot riff about on Twitter. A revised agreement between Mr. Musk and the Securities and Exchange Commission, filed in federal court in Manhattan on Friday, spells out just when Mr. Musk must “obtain the preapproval of any experienced securities lawyer” employed by Tesla before posting on Twitter or other social media. The list includes comments about the electric-car company’s financial condition, earnings forecast, proposed acquisitions and production data. But it also covers remarks about “nonpublic legal or regulatory findings or decisions” and any event that Tesla would have to disclose to the S.E.C. in a regulatory filing. A footnote to the settlement said, “This list is not intended to be an exhaustive list of topics,” meaning Mr. Musk is on notice to tread carefully when talking about anything that could move the company’s stock price. If approved by a federal judge, the deal would resolve an attempt by regulators to hold Mr. Musk in contempt of court for violating the earlier settlement. The agreement was changed after Judge Alison J. Nathan of Federal District Court in Manhattan said at a hearing this month that the original settlement, approved in October, had a “lack of clarity.” Judge Nathan asked the parties to try to draft a deal that better explained how Tesla’s lawyers should vet Mr. Musk’s posts and that included detailed procedures for dealing with posts that contained potential market-sensitive information. Urging the two sides to “take a deep breath” and put on “their reasonableness pants,” she gave the lawyers two weeks to report back. Last week, she agreed to a request by the commission and Mr. Musk for an additional week. Apparently nodding to Judge Nathan’s request, the new proposed settlement said the “enhanced clarity” as to which topics Mr. Musk cannot comment on without a lawyer’s approval should “reduce the likelihood of future disputes regarding compliance.” The latest regulatory scuffle between the S.E.C. and Mr. Musk was prompted by a Feb. 19 Twitter post by Mr. Musk that included information, which had not been reviewed by a lawyer, about the number of cars Tesla would produce and deliver this year. The commission contended that the post violated the terms of the October settlement, which followed the S.E.C.’s filing of a civil fraud complaint against Tesla and Mr. Musk over his declaration on Twitter that he had “funding secured” to take the company private at $420 a share. The prospect pushed Tesla shares sharply higher. But it turned out that Mr. Musk and Tesla were not actually close to reaching such a deal. Under the original settlement, Tesla was required to establish procedures for vetting Mr. Musk’s written communications, including Twitter posts, that might contain material information about the company. At the court hearing this month on the S.E.C.’s request for a contempt citation, John Hueston, a lawyer for Mr. Musk, argued that the settlement was imprecise and had resulted in a “murky policy” governing when Tesla’s lawyers had to review Mr. Musk’s posts. Cheryl Crumpton, a lawyer for the S.E.C., disagreed, but Judge Nathan indicated that she was inclined to agree with Mr. Hueston. Mr. Musk, who attended the hearing but did not speak, nodded at some of the judge’s comments. He later issued a statement supporting her order directing the parties to revisit the settlement. The Tesla chief executive has long feuded with the S.E.C., which he once derided on Twitter as the “Shortseller Enrichment Committee,’’ echoing his complaint that the bearish investors known as short-sellers spread damaging and false information about the company. But putting the dispute behind him may have become more urgent in light of his company’s recent financial performance. On Wednesday, Tesla gave even its most ardent supporters on Wall Street little to cheer about when it reported a $702 million quarterly loss. Sales of the company’s electric cars fell 31 percent from the fourth quarter. Shares of Tesla have tumbled 9 percent since the earnings report. The stock, which as recently as Thursday had a bigger market capitalization than Ford Motor, closed at $235.14 on Friday, its lowest level since early 2017. The stock was up about 1 percent in extended trading after the deal between Mr. Musk and the S.E.C. was filed in court. Some investors have complained that Mr. Musk’s battles with the commission have become an unnecessary distraction for him and the company. Securities lawyers said the revised list of things that Mr. Musk could not discuss on Twitter without seeking a lawyer’s approval seemed reasonable. “It recognizes that investors are smart enough to distinguish between tweets that contain material information regarding the company and its securities, on the one hand, and ‘Elon being Elon,’ on the other,” said Marc Leaf, a partner at Drinker Biddle & Reath in New York, who has previously worked at the S.E.C.",elon musk reach settlement,already clear securities regulators giving elon musk chief executive tesla laundry list things riff twitter revised agreement musk securities exchange commission filed federal court manhattan friday spells musk must obtain preapproval experienced securities lawyer employed tesla posting twitter social media list includes comments company financial condition earnings forecast proposed acquisitions production data also covers remarks nonpublic legal regulatory findings decisions event tesla would disclose regulatory filing footnote settlement said list intended exhaustive list topics meaning musk notice tread carefully talking anything could move company stock price approved federal judge deal would resolve attempt regulators hold musk contempt court violating earlier settlement agreement changed judge alison nathan federal district court manhattan said hearing month original settlement approved october lack judge nathan asked parties try draft deal better explained tesla lawyers vet musk posts included detailed procedures dealing posts contained potential information urging two sides take deep breath put reasonableness pants gave lawyers two weeks report back last week agreed request commission musk additional week apparently nodding judge nathan request new proposed settlement said enhanced clarity topics musk comment without lawyer approval reduce likelihood future disputes regarding latest regulatory scuffle musk prompted twitter post musk included information reviewed lawyer number cars tesla would produce deliver year commission contended post violated terms october settlement followed filing civil fraud complaint tesla musk declaration twitter funding secured take company private share prospect pushed tesla shares sharply higher turned musk tesla actually close reaching deal original settlement tesla required establish procedures vetting musk written communications including twitter posts might contain material information company court hearing month request contempt citation john hueston lawyer musk argued settlement imprecise resulted murky policy governing tesla lawyers review musk posts cheryl crumpton lawyer disagreed judge nathan indicated inclined agree hueston musk attended hearing speak nodded judge comments later issued statement supporting order directing parties revisit settlement tesla chief executive long feuded derided twitter shortseller enrichment committee echoing complaint bearish investors known spread damaging false information company putting dispute behind may become urgent light company recent financial performance wednesday tesla gave even ardent supporters wall street little cheer reported million quarterly loss sales company electric cars fell percent fourth quarter shares tesla tumbled percent since earnings report stock recently thursday bigger market capitalization ford motor closed friday lowest level since early stock percent extended trading deal musk filed court investors complained musk battles commission become unnecessary distraction company securities lawyers said revised list things musk could discuss twitter without seeking lawyer approval seemed reasonable recognizes investors smart enough distinguish tweets contain material information regarding company securities one hand elon elon said marc leaf partner drinker biddle reath new york previously worked

The late Friday agreement, which still needs to be approved by a judge, lays out exactly what kind of information requires formal legal review before being shared. This oversight process is now required for the company's blog, statements made on investor calls, as well as social media posts for material information. The filing laid out the following items in that list: Tesla did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Shares of Tesla gained about 0.9% in postmarket trading. The stock had shed 5% during the normal session and has fallen 29% so far in 2019. Friday's agreement ""removes an overhang"" for Tesla shareholders, said Dan Ives, managing director for equity research at Wedbush Securities. ""Some feared the SEC situation was not going to be resolved favorably so this resolution is a sigh of relief for the bulls. Tesla has enough bad news on its plate so this removes one headache for the Street with the focus now core demand and profitability,"" he said. This superseding agreement settles a dispute between the SEC and Musk about whether the Tesla chief violated the terms of their original deal in which he had agreed to clear his tweets containing material information about the company before posting. The SEC had asserted that Musk never sought clearance for any tweet. The U.S. regulatory agency had claimed that Musk broke the terms of that agreement in February when he tweeted about Tesla production numbers for 2019. The SEC first charged Musk last year, alleging he made fraudulent statements on Twitter. On Aug. 7, Musk tweeted that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share. In the first deal, Musk had also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $20 million and forfeit his role as chairman of the board for at least three years. The company also paid a $20 million fine. — CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",elon musk sec reach agreement tesla ceo use twitter,tesla ceo elon musk reached agreement securities exchange commission use twitter according amended filing district court southern district new york late friday agreement still needs approved judge lays exactly kind information requires formal legal review shared oversight process required company blog statements made investor calls well social media posts material information filing laid following items list tesla immediately reply request comment shares tesla gained postmarket trading stock shed normal session fallen far friday agreement removes overhang tesla shareholders said dan ives managing director equity research wedbush securities feared sec situation going resolved favorably resolution sigh relief bulls tesla enough bad news plate removes one headache street focus core demand profitability said superseding agreement settles dispute sec musk whether tesla chief violated terms original deal agreed clear tweets containing material information company posting sec asserted musk never sought clearance tweet regulatory agency claimed musk broke terms agreement february tweeted tesla production numbers sec first charged musk last year alleging made fraudulent statements twitter musk tweeted funding secured take tesla private per share first deal musk also agreed pay civil penalty million forfeit role chairman board least three years company also paid million fine cnbc lora kolodny contributed report

The new agreement provides much more detailed guidance about when tweets and other public statements by Musk must be approved by Tesla lawyers. Musk's original deal with the SEC was announced last September. It required Musk to obtain pre-approval for tweets that ""contain or could contain"" information that's material—legal jargon for information that's significant to shareholders. While the SEC expected Musk to begin regularly clearing tweets with lawyers, Musk interpreted this language as giving him significant discretion to decide for himself which tweets contained material information. As a result, he didn't seek legal review for any tweets in the first few months the agreement was in effect. In February, Musk tweeted that Tesla ""will make around 500k in 2019."" Hours later, he followed up with a clarifying tweet, stating that he ""meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k."" Musk didn't get this tweet cleared by Tesla lawyers. The SEC viewed that as a violation of the agreement and asked Judge Nathan to hold Musk in contempt. But rather than immediately punishing Musk, Nathan earlier this month ordered the parties to go back to the negotiating table. Now, Musk and the SEC have submitted a revision of last September's settlement that is a lot more specific about which statements require review by Tesla's lawyers. Under the new rules, Musk must get a Tesla securities lawyer's sign off on tweets (and other communications) regarding Tesla's finances, its production and delivery numbers, new lines of business, sales projections, proposed mergers, fundraising efforts, regulatory decisions, and several other types of information. The SEC says that if the judge signs off on these new terms, the SEC will drop its request for Musk to be held in contempt. In other words, the SEC seems to be satisfied with getting Musk to start seeking legal review for his tweets the way the agency thought Musk had been doing since last time. The SEC is not seeking to punish Musk further for his February tweet. But it's an open question whether Musk will be more cooperative now than he was in the wake of the original deal. The new terms require Musk to seek approval for production and delivery numbers—or projections about future numbers—unless those numbers were ""previously published via pre-approved written communications."" Yet Musk had argued that when he predicted the production of 500k vehicles, he didn't need to get legal review because he was merely summarizing guidance previously published by the company (the SEC disagreed, arguing that the 500k number was inconsistent with Tesla's guidance). So it's not hard to imagine Musk continuing to tweet out production estimates without legal review, arguing that they're close enough to Tesla's official guidance that he doesn't need a lawyer's approval.",elon musk reaches settlement sec tweet battle,elon musk reached deal securities exchange commission two parties said legal filing friday new agreement provides much detailed guidance tweets public statements musk must approved tesla lawyers musk original deal sec announced last september required musk obtain tweets contain could contain information jargon information significant shareholders sec expected musk begin regularly clearing tweets lawyers musk interpreted language giving significant discretion decide tweets contained material information result seek legal review tweets first months agreement effect february musk tweeted tesla make around hours later followed clarifying tweet stating meant say annualized production rate end probably around musk get tweet cleared tesla lawyers sec viewed violation agreement asked judge nathan hold musk contempt rather immediately punishing musk nathan earlier month ordered parties go back negotiating table musk sec submitted revision last september settlement lot specific statements require review tesla lawyers new rules musk must get tesla securities lawyer sign tweets communications regarding tesla finances production delivery numbers new lines business sales projections proposed mergers fundraising efforts regulatory decisions several types information sec says judge signs new terms sec drop request musk held contempt words sec seems satisfied getting musk start seeking legal review tweets way agency thought musk since last time sec seeking punish musk february tweet open question whether musk cooperative wake original deal new terms require musk seek approval production delivery projections future numbers previously published via written communications yet musk argued predicted production vehicles need get legal review merely summarizing guidance previously published company sec disagreed arguing number inconsistent tesla guidance hard imagine musk continuing tweet production estimates without legal review arguing close enough tesla official guidance need lawyer approval

These bold claims certainly stirred up some feelings among autonomous vehicle experts and industry leaders. On Friday, Velodyne president Marta Hall released a long statement — with a lot of ALL CAPS — defending her company's main product, LiDAR sensors for autonomous vehicles. While acknowledging Tesla's good work with electrification and car design, she shredded Musk's ""claims"" about deploying Teslas without a driver and without ""lame"" LiDAR sensors. Tesla only uses cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and a radar unit for its sensor suite. ""I personally like the Italian designed Tesla aesthetics and I applaud his leap toward the electrification of cars! Bravo! However, I would not trust its 'Autonomy,' claim, because the company has claimed its Auto Pilot feature is, 'Almost Autonomous.' IT IS NOT ALMOST AUTONOMOUS and it gives autonomy a bad rap,"" Hall wrote in an email statement. In her statement she also invited Musk to speak at her company's version of Autonomy Day, Velodyne's safety summit for autonomous vehicles, which will be held again this fall. Last year, Musk was also invited, but did not attend. Hall is part of a growing pool of skeptics highly critical of Musk and his robo-taxi dreams. Lyft COO Jon McNeill, who used to work at Tesla, is also dubious about a robot fleet of Tesla vehicles launching in such a short time. In a Business Insider interview this week, McNeill defended the need for drivers, even as self-driving accelerates, and called out Musk's ambitious plan. Lyft is investing in self-driving cars and currently operates a self-driving car service with autonomous company Aptiv in Las Vegas. ""I just don't know if that's possible to do,"" he told the publication about the autonomous fleet from Tesla. He went on to explain why autonomous won't be an immediate solution, ""even with autonomy happening over the next few years — or starting to be deployed over the next few years — we'll need more drivers in five years than we have today."" He doesn't think the pace of self-driving cars can keep up with demand for ride-hailing. So human drivers will still be needed, even if robo-cars are an option. Wall Street analyst Jeff Osborne from investment banking company Cowen wrote in a note after the autonomy presentation at Tesla headquarters in Palo Alto, ""The Tesla Network robotaxi plans seemed half baked."" CNBC collected other impressions about Tesla's autonomy plans from analysts who cover the self-driving space, like Adam Jones from Morgan Stanley who noted, ""We still think removing the safety driver will take many years (if not decades)."" Other self-driving experts, like Carnegie Mellon University professor Raj Rajkumar, also called out Musk, as told to the AP: ""It sounds like a pipe dream that he’s selling people."" Burgeoning research about camera placement in autonomous vehicles — and how it can capture 3D imaging like LiDAR if placed higher on the vehicle —could validate Musk's anti-LiDAR stance, but it doesn't change how overzealous Musk's timeline is.",elon musk annoying hell people work cars,elon musk really went week tesla autonomy day ripping widely used technology like laser sensors promising put million tesla taxis streets next year bold claims certainly stirred feelings among autonomous vehicle experts industry leaders friday velodyne president marta hall released long statement lot caps defending company main product lidar sensors autonomous vehicles acknowledging tesla good work electrification car design shredded musk claims deploying teslas without driver without lame lidar sensors tesla uses cameras ultrasonic sensors radar unit sensor suite personally like italian designed tesla aesthetics applaud leap toward electrification cars bravo however would trust claim company claimed auto pilot feature autonomous almost autonomous gives autonomy bad rap hall wrote email statement statement also invited musk speak company version autonomy day velodyne safety summit autonomous vehicles held fall last year musk also invited attend hall part growing pool skeptics highly critical musk dreams lyft coo jon mcneill used work tesla also dubious robot fleet tesla vehicles launching short time business insider interview week mcneill defended need drivers even accelerates called musk ambitious plan lyft investing cars currently operates car service autonomous company aptiv las vegas know possible told publication autonomous fleet tesla went explain autonomous wo immediate solution even autonomy happening next years starting deployed next years need drivers five years today think pace cars keep demand human drivers still needed even option wall street analyst jeff osborne investment banking company cowen wrote note autonomy presentation tesla headquarters palo alto tesla network robotaxi plans seemed half baked cnbc collected impressions tesla autonomy plans analysts cover space like adam jones morgan stanley noted still think removing safety driver take many years decades experts like carnegie mellon university professor raj rajkumar also called musk told ap sounds like pipe dream selling people burgeoning research camera placement autonomous vehicles capture imaging like lidar placed higher vehicle validate musk stance change overzealous musk timeline

The Securities and Exchange Commission and Musk reached the agreement, which they detailed in filings Friday in federal court in Manhattan. The agreement must be approved by U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan, who has presided over the case. The deal means Musk would no longer face the threat of being held in contempt as the SEC has demanded. The agency had alleged that Musk violated a previous settlement requiring his tweets to be approved by a lawyer if they disclose important company facts. Elon Musk and U.S. securities regulators have settled their dispute over the Tesla CEO's tweets, with Musk agreeing to having his future communications regarding the electric-car maker pre-approved by a company-employed expert The SEC said Musk violated the deal with a Feb. 19 tweet about Tesla vehicle production that wasn't approved by the company's 'disclosure counsel.' The agency contended that Musk hadn't sought the lawyer's approval for a single tweet. Musk's attorneys contended his tweet that Tesla would produce about 500,000 vehicles this year didn't need approval because it wasn't new information that would be meaningful to investors. They said the SEC was violating Musk's First Amendment rights to free speech. The new agreement requires Musk to get approval in advance from 'an experienced securities lawyer' employed by Tesla, which is based in Palo Alto, California, before he issues any written communication on a wide range of financial topics. It is more specific and detailed than the previous accord regarding the affected topics. Those range from Tesla's financial condition and results through potential mergers, sales numbers, new business lines and changes in control or top executive positions. Word of the agreement came one day after Musk and the SEC attorneys told Nathan they were still trying to work out an agreement and needed an extension of their deadline, to Tuesday. The original case goes back to a settlement reached last September after Musk tweeted that he had secured the funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share - a substantial premium over the company's stock price at the time - when he did not. That tweet, last August, sent Tesla's stock on a wild ride. The SEC maintains it hurt investors who bought the stock after the tweet but before they had accurate information.

The matter was then  revived last week when Mr Musk suggested to BuzzFeed that Mr Unsworth was a 'child rapist' However, in an order issued on Friday Judge Stephen Wilson denied Musk's request, allowing the case to go forward. Lin Wood, one of Unsworth's lawyers, told DailyMail.com: 'We are extremely pleased with the denial and I look forward to speaking with Musk under oath about his false, heinous accusations against Mr. Unsworth.' Unsworth, 63, is a British financial broker from St Albans, near London. He has a 40-year-old girlfriend of seven years, Woranan Ratrawiphukkun. The experienced diver was part of a team who successfully rescued a soccer team of 12 boys and a coach who got trapped for 18 days in a Thai cave last July. British diver Vern Unsworth played a leading role in the operation to rescue a group of boys trapped in a cave in Thailand. He got to meet Prime Minister Theresa May at Downing Street during a reception for those that helped with the Thai cave rescue operation Musk called diver Vernon Unsworth (pictured) a 'pedo' in a tweet to his 22.5 million followers after Unsworth criticized Musk's efforts to help rescue young soccer players trapped in a cave Woranan Ratrawiphukkun, 40 (left) has been in a relationship with British expat in Thailand (right) Vernon Unsworth for seven years Unsworth was hailed as a hero and was invited to visit the British Prime Minister at her residence in Number 10 Downing Street. In his lawsuit, filed in September, the Brit demanded at least $75,000 in compensatory damages plus unspecified punitive damages from Musk. On July 15 last year, the Telsa founder tweeted to his more than 22 million followers, calling Unsworth a 'pedo guy'. Although later apologizing, Musk doubled-down on his comments in an email to a Buzzfeed journalist, telling the reporter to investigate Unsworth and 'stop defending child rapists'. In their bid to get the case thrown out, Musk's lawyers characterized his slurs against Unsworth as 'over-the-top' comments in a 'schoolyard spat on social media'. They wrote the tweets and emails were 'just imaginative attacks; even if offensive, such speculative insults are by their nature opinion and protected by the First Amendment.' However, Judge Wilson was not persuaded, and denied Musk's request to dismiss the case.",elon musk must face british diver called twitter thai cave rescue,los angeles judge slapped elon musk bid defamation case thrown court musk called british hero vernon unsworth guy rapist twitter emails unsworth helped rescue boys stuck thai cave last year unsworth suing tesla mogul defamation california federal court musk asked judge throw case last month claiming tweets protected first amendment taken seriously elon musk asked california judge throw lawsuit filed british diver accused tech entrepreneur falsely calling pedophile judge refused musk labelled british diver guy tweet later deleting message musk later apologized twitter claiming words anger tech boss asking lawsuit dismissed mr musk right accused mr unsworth left paedo rescue schoolboys tham luang nang non cave complex last summer matter revived last week mr musk suggested buzzfeed mr unsworth rapist however order issued friday judge stephen wilson denied musk request allowing case go forward lin wood one unsworth lawyers told extremely pleased denial look forward speaking musk oath false heinous accusations mr unsworth unsworth british financial broker st albans near london girlfriend seven years woranan ratrawiphukkun experienced diver part team successfully rescued soccer team boys coach got trapped days thai cave last july british diver vern unsworth played leading role operation rescue group boys trapped cave thailand got meet prime minister theresa may downing street reception helped thai cave rescue operation musk called diver vernon unsworth pictured tweet million followers unsworth criticized musk efforts help rescue young soccer players trapped cave woranan ratrawiphukkun left relationship british expat thailand right vernon unsworth seven years unsworth hailed hero invited visit british prime minister residence number downing street lawsuit filed september brit demanded least compensatory damages plus unspecified punitive damages musk july last year telsa founder tweeted million followers calling unsworth guy although later apologizing musk comments email buzzfeed journalist telling reporter investigate unsworth defending child rapists bid get case thrown musk lawyers characterized slurs unsworth comments spat social media wrote tweets emails imaginative attacks even offensive speculative insults nature opinion protected first amendment however judge wilson persuaded denied musk request dismiss case

Further major problems are presented from the highly advanced technology to provide a car with the artificial intelligence required to drive as well as a human. The news comes after Tesla boss Elon Musk held his first Autonomy Day with investors this week, claiming he would have fully self-driving cars on the road by 2020. The UK government have also said they want self-driving cars within two years. Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks during the unveiling of the new Tesla Model Y in Hawthorne, California last month The Tesla Model Y is unveiled at Tesla's design studio in Hawthorne on March 14, 2019 Tesla said their computer is low cost and low power, as well as 'straightforward and simple.' It is responsible for processing and receiving data from the car's eight, 360-degree cameras Automotive Minister Richard Harrington said in February: 'We need to ensure we take the public with us as we move towards having self-driving cars on our roads by 2021. The update to the code of practice will provide clearer guidance to those looking to carry out trials on public roads.' But these claims seem bold compared to what 54 experts in the autonomous driving business told Forrester. One told the industry researchers they were held up by the fact the necessary 'sensor technology doesn't exist. Computing horsepower and algorithms don't exist yet. 'The amount of human judgement in driving in boundless conditions is such that it will take over 10 years before a computer can make all of the judgements in a guaranteed safer way than a human in all situations. 'The computer is going to have to be at least a factor of 10 better than what a human can do before the public will accept it.' Over a third of those surveyed noted serious concerns with software that is not behaving acceptably, expensive components, and securing the vehicle systems from hacking. Just one fifth of the experts said they had a reliable prototype in production. Tesla claims it has developed the 'best chip in the world' that will allow its cars to achieve full self-driving capabilities without the need for human intervention People stand in a Tesla showroom at a shopping mall in Los Angeles Another engineer said: 'Production-ready Level 5 [fully automated] vehicles will be more than 10 years [away]. And they will definitely only be in premium cars for a long time after that.' Self-driving cars often use a combination of normal two-dimensional cameras and depth-sensing 'LiDAR' units to recognise the world around them. In LiDAR (light detection and ranging) scanning one or more lasers send out short pulses, which bounce back when they hit an obstacle. These sensors constantly scan the surrounding areas looking for information, acting as the 'eyes' of the car. While the units supply depth information, their low resolution makes it hard to detect small, faraway objects without help from a normal camera linked to it in real time. In November last year Apple revealed details of its driverless car system that uses lasers to detect pedestrians and cyclists from a distance. The Apple researchers said they were able to get 'highly encouraging results' in spotting pedestrians and cyclists with just LiDAR data. They also wrote they were able to beat other approaches for detecting three-dimensional objects that use only LiDAR. Other self-driving cars generally rely on a combination of cameras, sensors and lasers. An example is Volvo's self driving cars that rely on around 28 cameras, sensors and lasers. To create a safe vehicle, the sensors on the car need to be prepared to detect what is happening on wet roads, in gusts of wind and surrounded by other drivers. These and other countless possibilities are all things the human brain processes rapidly, often subconsciously. One expert told Forrester they were 'very nervous' about the total uncertainty at this stage of development. 'We don’t know what we’re going to run into,' he told Forrester. 'How resistant do the sensors have to be to weather conditions? How do you even derive a safety test for an autonomous vehicle? Which scenario do you run it through?' But Tesla claim their new chip was low power and low cost, as well as straightforward and simple.' They say the chip has six billion transistors and can process 2.5 billion pixels per second from onboard cameras. 'It seems improbable. How could it be that Tesla, who has never designed a chip before, would design the best chip in the world?' Musk said on stage at the event, which was hosted at Tesla's Palo Alto, California headquarters. 'But that is objectively what has occurred. All Teslas being produced right now have this chip. 'All Tesla cars right now have everything necessary for full self-driving. All you have to do is update the software,' he added. Critics have pointed out that Tesla's autonomous software doesn't use LIDAR - a technology that's become commonplace in conversations about self-driving cars. LIDAR relies on laser sensors to assist with the car mapping its surroundings. 'LIDAR is a fool's errand,' Musk said. 'Anyone relying on LIDAR is doomed. A Tesla Model S whipping over snowy fields in the sunlight - the vehicle currently has an autopilot mode Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks before unveiling the Model Y at the company's design studio in Hawthorne on March 14 '...It's expensive, and unnecessary and as Andrej [Karpathy, Tesla's director of AI] was saying, once you solve vision, it's worthless to have expensive hardware on the car.' The company is now working on developing its next-generation chip, which Musk says is 'at least' three times better than the current version. Musk added that he expects the new chip to be ready in about two years.",driverless cars wo ready least decade experts say despite elon musk tesla claims,driverless cars least decade away machines remain vulnerable hacking industry experts say major problems presented highly advanced technology provide car artificial intelligence required drive well human news comes tesla boss elon musk held first autonomy day investors week claiming would fully cars road uk government also said want cars within two years tesla ceo elon musk speaks unveiling new tesla model hawthorne california last month tesla model unveiled tesla design studio hawthorne march tesla said computer low cost low power well simple responsible processing receiving data car eight cameras automotive minister richard harrington said february need ensure take public us move towards cars roads update code practice provide clearer guidance looking carry trials public roads claims seem bold compared experts autonomous driving business told forrester one told industry researchers held fact necessary technology exist computing horsepower algorithms exist yet amount human judgement driving boundless conditions take years computer make judgements guaranteed safer way human situations computer going least factor better human public accept third surveyed noted serious concerns software behaving acceptably expensive components securing vehicle systems hacking one fifth experts said reliable prototype production tesla claims developed chip world allow cars achieve full capabilities without need human intervention people stand tesla showroom shopping mall los angeles another engineer said level fully automated vehicles years away definitely premium cars long time cars often use combination normal cameras units recognise world around lidar light detection ranging scanning one lasers send short pulses bounce back hit obstacle sensors constantly scan surrounding areas looking information acting car units supply depth information low resolution makes hard detect small faraway objects without help normal camera linked real time november last year apple revealed details driverless car system uses lasers detect pedestrians cyclists distance apple researchers said able get encouraging results spotting pedestrians cyclists lidar data also wrote able beat approaches detecting objects use lidar cars generally rely combination cameras sensors lasers example volvo self driving cars rely around cameras sensors lasers create safe vehicle sensors car need prepared detect happening wet roads gusts wind surrounded drivers countless possibilities things human brain processes rapidly often subconsciously one expert told forrester nervous total uncertainty stage development know going run told forrester resistant sensors weather conditions even derive safety test autonomous vehicle scenario run tesla claim new chip low power low cost well straightforward simple say chip six billion transistors process billion pixels per second onboard cameras seems improbable could tesla never designed chip would design best chip world musk said stage event hosted tesla palo alto california headquarters objectively occurred teslas produced right chip tesla cars right everything necessary full update software added critics pointed tesla autonomous software use lidar technology become commonplace conversations cars lidar relies laser sensors assist car mapping surroundings fool errand musk said relying lidar doomed tesla model whipping snowy fields sunlight vehicle currently autopilot mode tesla ceo elon musk speaks unveiling model company design studio hawthorne march expensive unnecessary andrej karpathy tesla director ai saying solve vision worthless expensive hardware car company working developing chip musk says least three times better current version musk added expects new chip ready two years

The IT manager turned his curiosity into YouTube fame in 2016, cranking out videos about the cars, including how to buy, fix and mine wrecked Teslas for spare parts. ""The reason I started my YouTube channel was to kind of demystify Teslas in general. So I purchased a Tesla Model S a few years ago, and I started taking it apart to see if I could put it back together,"" Benoit said. Today, his channel ""Rich Rebuilds "" is approaching 500,000 subscribers. The most popular episode, ""Can you drown a Tesla motor?"" has garnered 2.3 million views in less than a year. Dubbing him ""Dr. Frankenstein of Teslas,"" his followers frequently send payments to support his video blogging habit, as well as random items for his cars, home and garage. He's received custom car parts like lug nuts, door handles, mats, as well as air fresheners, cleaning products and more. Someone sent him a life-sized poster of Elon Musk. Someone had pizza delivered to his house, which Benoit liked. On the weirder side of viral video stardom, a fan sent Benoit a puppy preserved in formaldehyde in a jar. Over the years, Benoit said, followers increasingly reached out asking where to get a good deal on a spare part, or offering to pay him to fix their cars when Tesla service centers couldn't or wouldn't do so. In the winter of 2018, Benoit partnered with a former parts manager for Tesla, Chris Salvo, to open up their own repair shop. Salvo is also the founder of EV Tuning, an online store that sells parts and accessories to electric vehicle owners. While they have both been holding down day jobs, this spring they broke ground on their Electrified Garage in Seabrook, New Hampshire. ""I was never thinking of opening my own shop,"" Benoit said. ""But I'd been denied so many times by Tesla that I really started thinking there's got to be a bigger picture here, another player who can help others and get parts as well. Now there's a place where people can go for third-party EV repair."" Their typical customers own Model S cars out of warranty, or Model 3's with after-market parts that have negated their warranties so they can't get Tesla do work for them, according to Benoit and Salvo. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long promised to ramp up the company's service in North America. In July 2018, he tweeted, ""Tesla body shops are ramping up fast. Aiming to go from 30+ days using external body repair shops to same day body repair with prestocked parts at Tesla service centers.""  But Tesla is currently in a belt-tightening phase, recovering from mass layoffs and still under pressure to cut costs. So it's not clear when the company can make good on Musk's promises. This week, the CEO told Tesla service skeptics on Twitter, ""we're ramping up service centers & Tesla mobile service worldwide.""  Until more service centers open, or Tesla adds capacity and technicians, including ""Rangers"" – who drive to the customers' door to fix their cars – upstarts like the Electrified Garage are ready to repair, modify or rebuild.",rebel tesla rebuilder popular youtube channel opening shop fix cars tesla ca,rich benoit enchanted tesla electric vehicles since company first rolled flagship sedan model manager turned curiosity youtube fame cranking videos cars including buy fix mine wrecked teslas spare parts reason started youtube channel kind demystify teslas general purchased tesla model years ago started taking apart see could put back together benoit said today channel rich rebuilds approaching subscribers popular episode drown tesla motor garnered million views less year dubbing frankenstein teslas followers frequently send payments support video blogging habit well random items cars home garage received custom car parts like lug nuts door handles mats well air fresheners cleaning products someone sent poster elon musk someone pizza delivered house benoit liked weirder side viral video stardom fan sent benoit puppy preserved formaldehyde jar years benoit said followers increasingly reached asking get good deal spare part offering pay fix cars tesla service centers could would winter benoit partnered former parts manager tesla chris salvo open repair shop salvo also founder ev tuning online store sells parts accessories electric vehicle owners holding day jobs spring broke ground electrified garage seabrook new hampshire never thinking opening shop benoit said denied many times tesla really started thinking got bigger picture another player help others get parts well place people go ev repair typical customers model cars warranty model parts negated warranties ca get tesla work according benoit salvo tesla ceo elon musk long promised ramp company service north america july tweeted tesla body shops ramping fast aiming go days using external body repair shops day body repair prestocked parts tesla service centers tesla currently phase recovering mass layoffs still pressure cut costs clear company make good musk promises week ceo told tesla service skeptics twitter ramping service centers tesla mobile service worldwide service centers open tesla adds capacity technicians including rangers drive customers door fix cars upstarts like electrified garage ready repair modify rebuild

The introduction of semi-autonomous, driver-assistance systems that can control steering, braking, and acceleration in some circumstances, but require that the driver be ready to take over, has raised questions about how well people can pay attention to the road as their cars handle an increasing percentage of driving tasks. Much of this debate has centered around Autopilot, which was a pioneer among semi-autonomous systems when it was introduced in 2015. Tesla has presented data that indicates drivers get in fewer accidents when Autopilot is activated, but the data doesn't provide enough detail to isolate the effect of Autopilot from other factors, like the fact that fewer accidents occur on highways, where it appears Autopilot is most often used, than on residential streets. Fatal accidents involving Autopilot highlight its limitations, but are too anecdotal to draw broad conclusions. Read more: Elon Musk's prediction that it will have a robo-taxi service ready by the end of 2020 is a 'publicity stunt,' an expert says The MIT study, titled, ""Human Side of Tesla Autopilot: Exploration of Functional Vigilance in Real-World Human-Machine Collaboration,"" sought to observe how well Autopilot users were able to remain aware of their surroundings and take over from the system when necessary. The researchers looked at 8,729 instances in which Autopilot was deactivated, either by the driver or the system itself, before encountering a potentially dangerous situation, and how quickly the driver reacted to it. (Each of the 21 vehicles included in the study had cameras filming the driver, the vehicle's interior, and the area in front of the vehicle.) If the driver took more than one second to react to the potentially dangerous situation, the researchers designated the response as being late. Drivers responded late in none of the 8,729 instances in which Autopilot was deactivated before a potentially dangerous situation, a result that surprised the study's authors. ""In our data, drivers use Autopilot frequently and remain functionally vigilant in their use,"" the authors wrote. ""These results are surprising as they do not align with the prediction of prior literature on human monitoring of automation."" The authors give two possible explanation for the drivers' ability to react quickly: They knew Autopilot was imperfect and used it in situations it was not designed for, both of which made them extra attentive. But the study's results do not prove that Autopilot users, as a whole, are attentive when using the system. The authors emphasize that their findings cannot be extended to all Autopilot users or to other semi-autonomous systems, in part because of its relatively small sample size, the subjective process used to evaluate driver reactions, and the fact that the study did not record instances in which drivers faced potentially dangerous situations that did not lead to an Autopilot deactivation. While the study does not settle questions about Autopilot's safety, the results are encouraging for Tesla, and they illustrate that there is still much to learn about the relationship between drivers and semi-autonomous technology.

CNBC reports that Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean at the Yale School of Management, didn’t hold back when discussing Tesla’s first-quarters earnings report. “When is the board going to wake up?” asked Sonnenfeld, “You know what they are? They do understand cruise control better than anybody else. The board is on ‘cruise control.'” This was an obvious reference to Tesla’s autopilot feature which the company has claimed will allow cars to drive themselves, a claim which has been repeatedly questioned. Based on average estimates compiled by Refinitiv, here’s what Tesla reported versus what analysts expected: Although Tesla’s sale of vehicles rose by 36 percent to $3.72 billion from $2.74 billion a year ago, it still represented a 41 percent drop from the fourth quarter. Tesla appeared aware of this warning investors that first-quarter income would  “be negatively impacted” due to “lower than expected delivery volumes and several pricing adjustments.” Sonnenfeld, who has decades of experience studying CEO leadership and corporate governance was, however, not impressed. According to Sonnefeld, Tesla’s first-quarter figures were the “worst disaster” in the technology sector that “a lot of us can remember in a long time.” Sonnefeld stated that it wasn’t just that Musk has “dramatically failed in expectations but it’s that he set these expectations himself.” Sonnenfeld noted that Tesla’s stock is not trading “anywhere near $420,” a reference to the price point that Musk said he would take Tesla private at in a tweet on August 7, 2018, which resulted in a severe fine from the SEC. Sonnefeld also referred to Musk’s predictions that 1 million Tesla robotaxis with no human drivers would be available on the U.S. market next year, calling this claim “ludicrous.” Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

With less than one in five Americans reading just for fun these days, we've done the hard work for you by scouring the internet for the most interesting, thought provoking books on science and technology we can find and delivering an easily digestible nugget of their stories. Modern tech culture has long been enamored with the mythos of the lone genius achieving superhuman status (a la The Matrix). Whether it's Jack Dorsey's self flagellating dietary restrictions, Peter Thiel's obsession with ""young blood"" transfusions, or Tim Ferris' outright maniacal 4-hour self improvement regimens, if you're a wealthy white guy in Silicon Valley and not trying to live forever, you're doing it wrong. But for all the Bond villain-esque grifters selling the promise of eternal youth in 12 easy steps, a dedicated cadre of technologists have spent years investigating how we might actually achieve Ray Kurzweil's predicted singularity. In the excerpt below from Hacking Life: Systematized Living and Its Discontents, author Joseph M. Reagle, Jr. examines the origins of Transhumanism and the movement's vulnerability to degrading into a cultish practice of ""healthism."" As a kid, I loved the opening sequence of The Six Million Dollar Man, which begins with footage of an aeronautic catastrophe. Astronaut Steve Austin is barely alive, and over scenes of surgery and bionic schematics a voice declares: ""We can rebuild him. We have the technology. We can make him better than he was. Better ... stronger ... faster."" These three words are the title of the 2011 New Yorker profile of Tim Ferriss; two of them also appear in the title of the 2016 self-help book Smarter Faster Better: The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business. A clip from a 1970s TV show, of using science and technology to enhance human performance, lingers as a way of describing an aspiration to be superhuman. Two of [mononymed author] Tynan's most popular titles are Superhuman by Habit and Superhuman Social Skills. Tim Ferriss's book The 4-Hour Body is, according to its subtitle, An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman. The mantra of his TV show is that ""you don't need to be superhuman to get superhuman results ... you just need a better toolkit."" The bionic man's treatment was not only therapeutic: he was enhanced. Similarly, the goal of optimal hacking is to transcend the nominal. Of course, the desire to rise above is not new. In Greek mythology, Icarus flew too close to the sun. In Abrahamic mythology, the people of Babel dared to build a tower that could reach heaven. Neither of these myths spoke to genuine possibilities. Rather, they warned of hubris, and Icarus and the people of Babel were scattered upon the earth. But with the advances of science in the twentieth century, some hoped that real transcendence was imminent. In 1957 Julian Huxley, an evolutionary biologist, wrote Transhumanism in the belief that ""the human species can, if it wishes, transcend itself—not just sporadically, an individual here in one way, an individual there in another way, but in its entirety, as humanity."" His mechanism for this transcendence was a progressive eugenics. Huxley was skeptical of the biological notion of race and cognizant of its abuses, so he proposed raising the living standard of the ""poorest classes"" via a ""curative and remedial"" program. Huxley knew that education and health care led to people having fewer children. Raising the living standard among the impoverished accomplished two things. Those who never had a chance to meet their potential would finally be able to do so. Those with little potential would live better lives and have fewer children, lessening their effect on the human stock. This philosophy informed much of his work, including as the first Director- General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). In subsequent decades, personal technologies displaced population eugenics as the expected driver of change. In the 1980s, transhumanists looked to genetic engineering and nanotechnology. In the 1990s, computers and networks led to predictions of artificial intelligences and cyborgs; they also inspired the possibility of becoming posthuman. Mark O'Connell explains this far-fetched notion in his 2017 book To Be a Machine: Adventures among Cyborgs, Utopians, Hackers, and the Futurists Solving the Modest Problem of Death. Executives and investors at companies including Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Tesla speak of a near future of machine intelligence. Some find this worrying. Tesla's Elon Musk routinely warns the public of an artificial intelligence apocalypse. Others eagerly anticipate the rise of machines smarter than us. Of these optimistic Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, O'Connell writes that ""these men -- they were men, after all, almost to a man—all spoke of a future in which humans would merge with machines."" For example, in 2012 Google hired a new engineering director, inventor and transhumanist Ray Kurzweil, to lead its efforts at machine learning. The following year, the company also launched a $750 million biotech company focused on anti-aging. Kurzweil is famous for predicting in his 2005 book, The Singularity Is Near, that by around 2045 technology will advance so rapidly, as it learns to improve itself, that human life will become, literally, immaterial. Pessimists like Musk fear we will be wiped out. Optimists like Kurzweil think we will merge with our creations and live forever. In any case, Google has both the synthetic and organic bases covered. Beyond inspiration, the internet gave transhumanists a means to find one another, to cohere. In 1994 Wired published ""Meet the Extropians,"" a profile of the latest transhuman advocates. Just as entropy is the universal tendency toward disorder, extropy is an opposing force, pushing us toward transcendence. Transhumanism sees the power of humanistic values, like creativity and reason, as expanding when coupled with technological advances. And extropianism is, in its most recent version, distilled into five principles: boundless expansion (of wisdom, effectiveness, life span), self-transformation (through reason and experimentation), dynamic optimism (rational and action based), intelligent technologies (so as to transcend our natural limits), and spontaneous order (arising from decentralized social coordination). It might seem like a reach to connect those trying to manage their inbox or migraines with extropians. Yet the latter's five principles encompass the hacker ethos. And Kevin Kelly believes QS will address cosmic questions. Elsewhere he writes that extropy is driving us toward the inevitable emergence of an information superorganism. He's not as audacious as Kurzweil, but they are simpatico. Not every life hacker is an extropian, but both movements are drawn from the same wellspring, the Californian Ideology. As a New Republic essay about ""the hackers trying to solve the problem of death"" put it: the pursuit of ""extended youth, neurological enhancement, and physical prowess ... carries with it a distinctly Californian air of self-improvement, of better living through technology."" This ideology intensifies a trend toward what scholars refer to as ""healthism,"" wherein the struggle for well-being is privatized, categorizing health as an individual virtue and illness as a moral failing. Much as productivity hacking can devolve into an oppressive regime of self-flagellation, health hacking can become an accusatory regime of vigor, with blame falling on those too sick to keep up. Not everyone has the resources of Kurzweil, who for a time employed an assistant to keep his hundreds of supplements straight. The ultimate irony of the extropian view, of better living through technology, is that the optimal life is achieved only when it ceases to be living, in the biological sense. Until then, though, there are lots of other hacks for being better, stronger, faster—and even smarter. Excerpted from Hacking Life: Systematized Living and Its Discontents by Joseph M.

Sign up here. Because nothing heads off the Sunday night blues like feeling prepared to deal with know-it-all co-workers, here’s your weekly catch-up on all the tech and business news you missed, plus the important stuff for the week ahead. Enjoy the rest of your day. APRIL 21-27 Last Monday, Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, ran a demonstration of the company’s driverless cars and boldly claimed that he would have a fleet of autonomous taxis on the road next year. (Other experts say the vehicles are a few years from road readiness, at least.) Two days later, Tesla reported steep first-quarter losses, even worse than predicted. The company attributed the poor numbers to sluggish sales of its much-ballyhooed Model 3 sedan, which has suffered from production issues and lagging demand. But analysts saw it as yet another example of Mr. Musk’s tendency to overpromise and underdeliver. Boeing’s troubled fleet of 737 Max jets has come home to roost, in the form of dismal quarterly numbers. The company’s stock slid last week after it posted its worst results in years, including a $1 billion hit to its commercial plane division. Boeing also didn’t provide its usual forecast for future sales and profits, as investigators are still trying to figure out what caused the two similar crashes of the 737 Max in the past year (and, more important, how to prevent them from happening again). Until then, a big chunk of Boeing’s business is out of commission. Facebook has long been under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission for playing fast and loose with its users’ privacy (Exhibit A: The Cambridge Analytica scandal, when Facebook shared its users’ personal information with a political consulting firm without their consent). Now, the company is prepared to do penance for those violations — and get the F.T.C. off its back — by paying up to $5 billion in fines, a record-high penalty for a tech company in the United States. Which sounds bad. But is it really? Critics called it a slap on the wrist, certainly not painful enough to force real change. And Facebook itself seems unbowed. It announced plans to pay the settlement at the same time that it posted higher-than-expected quarterly earnings, and its stock soared afterward. APRIL 28- may 4 The most fussed-about initial public offering of the year is almost here. Uber is aiming for a price range of $44 to $50 a share, which would put its total value at around $91 billion when it starts trading in early May. That’s higher than the ride-hailing company’s most recent appraisal of $76 billion last August, but lower than the $100 billion valuation that was floating around a few weeks ago. So are Uber’s shares a good deal or not? During a 10-day roadshow this coming week, its leaders will attempt to convince investors that, despite its $1.8 billion loss last year, Uber’s future is bright — and it won’t repeat the lackluster post-I.P.O. performance of its smaller rival, Lyft. The Federal Reserve will meet on Wednesday to decide whether to change interest rates, but don’t hold your breath. Fed officials made it clear earlier this year that they had no plans to raise rates in the foreseeable future, citing the country’s slowing economic growth. (They’re also under pressure from President Trump to keep rates as low as possible, whether they want to listen or not.) Still, the Commerce Department reported on Friday that the United States’ economy grew at a robust rate of 3.2 percent last quarter, a much rosier number than anticipated. Might that prompt the Fed to rethink its interest rate outlook? Yes, Amazon is still making boatloads of money. (You didn’t think a divorce and a scandalous photo drama would hinder its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, did you?) Last Thursday, the e-commerce behemoth posted its biggest quarterly profit to date ($3.6 billion), blowing past analysts’ expectations. Up next, the company will focus on speeding up its free delivery for Prime members, shortening the time to one day from two. It’ll cost Amazon a lot in the short run (about $800 million), but may give it the edge it needs to boost its slowing retail sales and stay ahead of competitors. Autonomous drones produced by Google’s Wing Aviation have gotten the go-ahead from the Federal Aviation Administration to make small commercial deliveries (like, say, a burger) from businesses to people’s homes. Speaking of which, Beyond Meat, which makes juicy veggie patties that really look and taste like beef, is planning to go public later this year. In other news, two Google employees who led a protest against the company’s treatment of sexual harassment say they have since faced retaliation at work.",interest week business tesla driverless taxis uber,want column inbox sign nothing heads sunday night blues like feeling prepared deal weekly tech business news missed plus important stuff week ahead enjoy rest day april last monday tesla chief executive elon musk ran demonstration company driverless cars boldly claimed would fleet autonomous taxis road next year experts say vehicles years road readiness least two days later tesla reported steep losses even worse predicted company attributed poor numbers sluggish sales model sedan suffered production issues lagging demand analysts saw yet another example musk tendency overpromise underdeliver boeing troubled fleet max jets come home roost form dismal quarterly numbers company stock slid last week posted worst results years including billion hit commercial plane division boeing also provide usual forecast future sales profits investigators still trying figure caused two similar crashes max past year important prevent happening big chunk boeing business commission facebook long investigation federal trade commission playing fast loose users privacy exhibit cambridge analytica scandal facebook shared users personal information political consulting firm without consent company prepared penance violations get back paying billion fines penalty tech company united states sounds bad really critics called slap wrist certainly painful enough force real change facebook seems unbowed announced plans pay settlement time posted quarterly earnings stock soared afterward april may initial public offering year almost uber aiming price range share would put total value around billion starts trading early may higher company recent appraisal billion last august lower billion valuation floating around weeks ago uber shares good deal roadshow coming week leaders attempt convince investors despite billion loss last year uber future bright repeat lackluster performance smaller rival lyft federal reserve meet wednesday decide whether change interest rates hold breath fed officials made clear earlier year plans raise rates foreseeable future citing country slowing economic growth also pressure president trump keep rates low possible whether want listen still commerce department reported friday united states economy grew robust rate percent last quarter much rosier number anticipated might prompt fed rethink interest rate outlook yes amazon still making boatloads money think divorce scandalous photo drama would hinder chief executive jeff bezos last thursday behemoth posted biggest quarterly profit date billion blowing past analysts expectations next company focus speeding free delivery prime members shortening time one day two cost amazon lot short run million may give edge needs boost slowing retail sales stay ahead competitors autonomous drones produced google wing aviation gotten federal aviation administration make small commercial deliveries like say burger businesses people homes speaking beyond meat makes juicy veggie patties really look taste like beef planning go public later year news two google employees led protest company treatment sexual harassment say since faced retaliation work

On Friday afternoon, Musk — a voracious tweeter and the head of Tesla, a publicly traded electric car company monitored by the SEC — reached an agreement with the regulatory agency after a February tweet about car production numbers. Earlier in April, a federal court judge in Manhattan gave Musk and the SEC a few weeks to sort out what the agency considered contempt, even after Musk wrote a clarifying tweet. It was determined that the rules the SEC set for Musk's tweets were too ambiguous. Musk's legal team argued at one point that the SEC was trying to take away his First Amendment rights. After an extended discussion period that consumed most of April, the two parties finally agreed Friday on new terms for the settlement, mostly concerning what Musk can and can't tweet about. Since the agreement went up Musk hasn't been able to stay away from tweeting about it. He wrote in a Twitter conversation about who he responds to that ""the foolish things I say are entirely my fault,"" with a winking-tongue-out emoji. Someone interjected that Musks writes ""not many foolish things."" To which Musk responded: ""certain regulatory agencies would beg to differ,"" in a clear call out to the SEC. This all started in the summer of 2018 when Musk tweeted about taking Tesla private. The SEC said that the tweet violated federal securities laws and eventually the two parties settled. Part of that settlement (which also included $40 million in fines) was that Musk's tweets would be monitored, and he'd have to get approval if they included any ""material"" information about his company that would affect trading. That did not happen. So when that February tweet came around, the SEC flagged it as a violation of their agreement. And   now we've got a much clearer set of rules Musk has to abide by when he posts on Twitter. A full bullet pointed list (with sub-bullets!) was in the proposed agreement. Now Musk needs pre-approval to tweet about anything from this list: Here's the full agreement: The next step is getting the judge's approval on the agreement.

The ""subscribe to PewDiePie"" meme began as the result of the YouTuber's struggle to defend his title of most-subscribed YouTube channel against Bollywood music channel T-Series. In an unusually sombre video, PewDiePie addressed the fact that since then, the slogan ""subscribe to PewDiePie"" has appeared in two abhorrent acts. First was in March when a World War II memorial in New York was defaced with graffiti reading ""subscribe to PewDiePie."" Later that month, the Christchurch shooter referred to the meme during his livestream of the attack, in which the suspect killed 50 people in two mosques. PewDiePie released a short tweet at the time condemning the act, and in his video said he didn't say anything more out of respect for the victims and their families. ""I just didn't want to address it right away, and I didn't want to give the terrorist more attention. I didn't want to make it about me, because I don't think it has anything to do with me. To put it plainly, I didn't want hate to win,"" he said. ""But it's clear to me now the 'subscribe to PewDiePie' movement should have ended then."" PewDiePie also addressed criticism of the two ""diss tracks"" he released mocking T-Series, which an Indian high court ruled must be blocked in the country because they contain racist jokes. PewDiePie said the tracks were meant ""in fun, ironic jest,"" but said that he would keep the videos blocked. ""This was made to be fun, but it's clearly not fun anymore. It's clearly gone too far,"" PewDiePie said.

Now, one cat lover has revealed plans to launch the ashes of his cat , Pikachu, into space, for a burial like no other. Steve Munt, from Lake Oswego, Oregon, has launched a GoFundMe page dedicated to raising funds for the cosmic burial. On the page, he wrote: “Pikachu will have a final send-off like no cat has ever had before. “A portion of his remains, from his heart, will be launched into orbit, where he will watch over the Earth, and we can track his location as he showers the world with love.” Mr Munt plans to send the ashes through a company called Celestis, which offers memorial spaceflights for humans, as well as pets. However, the unique burial isn’t cheap. Celestis charges $5,000 (£3,864) for its ‘Earth orbit pet launch service’, which sees the ashes ‘placed in Earth orbit where it remains until it reenters the atmosphere, harmlessly vaporizing like a shooting star in final tribute.’ Mr Munt is still a way off his GoFundMe target, raising $2,100 at the time of publishing. However, speaking to space.com , he revealed that the has already paid for the service, using his own savings. He said: “I have already signed the contract and just recently paid in full for the service. While I continue to accept donations for those who wish to be a part of this tribute, fundraising is not a primary goal for me. “My dream is coming true, regardless of any additional donations, and I am currently awaiting an assigned slot on a future launch.""",ashes cat launched space burial cat,chimpanzee tesla roadster range weird wonderful items launched space past one cat lover revealed plans launch ashes cat pikachu space burial like steve munt lake oswego oregon launched gofundme page dedicated raising funds cosmic burial page wrote pikachu final like cat ever portion remains heart launched orbit watch earth track location showers world mr munt plans send ashes company called celestis offers memorial spaceflights humans well pets however unique burial cheap celestis charges earth orbit pet launch service sees ashes placed earth orbit remains reenters atmosphere harmlessly vaporizing like shooting star final mr munt still way gofundme target raising time publishing however speaking revealed already paid service using savings said already signed contract recently paid full service continue accept donations wish part tribute fundraising primary goal dream coming true regardless additional donations currently awaiting assigned slot future launch

This is one area where government's Brexit paralysis could be of benefit,"Britain’s fracking Commissioner has fracked off, blaming the government for creating a “de facto ban” on the process. Extracting shale gas by hydraulic fracturing is a controversial business, not least because of the earthquakes that have, on occasion, been created where it’s been tried but that's far from the only environmental concern. Natascha Engel launched a media broadside at the regulations covering the industry with her resignation from the post of Shale Gas Commissioner, which she announced with a flourish at the weekend. The rules call for the process to be suspended whenever a 0.5 magnitude tremor is detected. Engel, in post for about six months, described this as “ridiculously low” in a TV interview. She argued that the the industry would “struggle to develop” if the government refuses to change course, and there is scant sign of that. She went even further in her resignation letter, accusing ministers of “pandering to myths and scare stories” with the limit while claiming that environmental groups are driving policy. Would that we had the power to do so, they would probably say in response, given the climate emergency the whole planet is facing and the notable lack of action from government in response to a range of other environmental issues that are of real and pressing concern. Examples? How about the mountains of waste we are creating, through non recyclable coffee cups and supermarket packaging. Then there’s the government’s relaxed approach to weedkillers like Glyphosate, which you can buy at your local DIY chain despite the World Health Organisation declaring it to be a probable cause of cancer and a couple of very big verdicts against in the US. If environmental groups were driving policy, as Engel claims, then why does Britain have such a poor environmental record? Fracking is a controversial process with good reason. Engel rightly says that Britain needs to lower its carbon emissions. Where she and her critics would disagree is over whether fracking is the right way to go about it. The gas it produces still emits carbon into the atmosphere, when there are alternative, and more environmentally friendly, routes that could be pursued. Energy from renewable sources has, for example, developed at a pace that even the most optimistic of observers would have hesitated to predict a few years ago. Engel, who has also worked as an advisor to energy company Ineos following her departure from Parliament in 2017, was appointed with a view to smoothing the somewhat rocky relationship between contractors and local communities.",fracking furore shale gas commissioner quits one area government brexit paralysis could benefit,britain fracking commissioner fracked blaming government creating de facto ban process extracting shale gas hydraulic fracturing controversial business least earthquakes occasion created tried far environmental concern natascha engel launched media broadside regulations covering industry resignation post shale gas commissioner announced flourish weekend rules call process suspended whenever magnitude tremor detected engel post six months described ridiculously low tv interview argued industry would struggle develop government refuses change course scant sign went even resignation letter accusing ministers pandering myths scare stories limit claiming environmental groups driving policy would power would probably say response given climate emergency whole planet facing notable lack action government response range environmental issues real pressing concern examples mountains waste creating non recyclable coffee cups supermarket packaging government relaxed approach weedkillers like glyphosate buy local diy chain despite world health organisation declaring probable cause cancer couple big verdicts us environmental groups driving policy engel claims britain poor environmental record fracking controversial process good reason engel rightly says britain needs lower carbon emissions critics would disagree whether fracking right way go gas produces still emits carbon atmosphere alternative environmentally friendly routes could pursued energy renewable sources example developed pace even optimistic observers would hesitated predict years ago engel also worked advisor energy company ineos following departure parliament appointed view smoothing somewhat rocky relationship contractors local communities

The company said it took out three advertisements outside Reuters' Times Square headquarters to demand Tesla provide compensation and better customer service after more than 20% of the 278 cars it purchased experienced ""electro-mechanical failures."" Global Times, the Chinese government-aligned newspaper, first reported on the scuffle. ""Shenma special vehicle and Tesla have made repeated negotiations but Tesla's internal efficiency is low, resulting in unsatisfactory after-sales service, long processing time for complaints, and delays in solving vehicle problems,"" Shenma said on its official Weibo account, adding that wait time for service had averaged 45 days, costing the company 6.5 million yuan, or about $965,000. A Tesla representative declined to comment. Shenma also took its complaints to a Tesla retail store in Chengdu, where it made a statement and held signs with similar messaging as its Times Square campaign. Weibo Last week, a video of a Tesla Model S appearing to catch fire without cause in a Shanghai parking garage made waves on social media in the country. A Tesla representative said it was investigating the fire alongside local authorities. According to Reuters, there have been at least 14 instances of Tesla vehicles igniting in the past six years, most of which occurred after a crash.

Reuters reports that Elon Musk’s electric car manufacturer Tesla is considering seeking alternative sources of funding following the posting of a $700 million loss in the first quarter. During an earnings call, CEO Elon Musk stated: “There is some merit to raising capital. It’s probably about the right time.” Analysts had previously expected that the company may need to raise further capital for the expansion of its factories, including the development of its new Shanghai facility. The production of the company’s new Model Y SUV and other projects would also require some serious funding. In a regulatory filing, Tesla stated: “We continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business.” The company claims to have $2.2 billion in cash equivalents and has projected capital expenditures of $2.5 billion to $3 billion over the course of the year; Tesla’s current total debt stands at $10.33 billion. “We may need or want to raise additional funds in the future, and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them, or at all,” Tesla said in its recent regulatory filing. Last week, Elon Musk and the Securities Exchange Commission reached an agreement on the CEO’s use of Twitter which has previously cost him and Tesla fines totaling $40 million. It was agreed that Musk can tweet whatever he likes, apart from information about certain events or financial goals. If Musk is to tweet about these, he must seek pre-approval from a securities lawyer. According to TechCrunch, if Musk’s tweets contain the following items he must seek pre-approval: Breitbart News will continue to follow Tesla’s financial moves.

Much has been made about Amazon's growing digital ad business — which, in terms of revenue, has established itself as the third biggest player in the market behind Facebook and Google. But Wall Street thinks the Amazon threat is too early to show a significant impact on Google. ""Feedback suggests that the ramp in Amazon advertising is having limited impact on core Google search spend, despite negative media headlines to the contrary,"" Colin Sebastian, a Senior Research Analyst at Baird Equity Research, wrote in an investor's note last week. Google's advertising revenue was $32.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, up almost 20% from the year prior. Wall Street analysts expect Google-parent company Alphabet's gross revenue in first three months of the year to total $37.3 billion, up roughly 20% year-over-year. Read more: Amazon's nascent ad business is bigger than it's ever been — and it's starting to make inroads with big brands Dan Ives, a Managing Director of Equity Research at Wedbush Securities, told Business Insider in a recent interview that any time Amazon enters a market, it should be cause for concern for incumbents. But for now, he says, ""the bark is worse than the bite,"" when it comes to Amazon's threat to Google's ad business. ""It's an opportunity for Amazon from an advertising perspective,"" Ives said. ""But I don't see it moving the needle too much for Google."" For Google's parent company, Alphabet, the first quarter of 2019 has been a busy one for its other businesses outside of advertising, which it describes on its balance sheet as ""other bets."" In March, the company announced its ambitious new video game streaming platform, Stadia, which is scheduled to be available sometime in 2019. Also in March, the company's autonomous car company Waymo grew its operations in Arizona to help expand its driverless ridesharing service program, which it's currently testing and hoping to rival the likes of Uber and Lyft. The ""other bet"" catching most of Wall Street's attention, however, is its cloud computing business — Google Cloud Platform (GCP) — under the leadership of the recently appointed Oracle veteran, Thomas Kurian. ""With Kurian now running the show, this is a big opportunity for Google to potentially gain a part of that market,"" Ives said. Today, Amazon and Microsoft dominate the cloud market, though Google's new leader has already taken strides to expand its share. In April, at the company's annual conference — Google Cloud Next — GCP unveiled its new hybrid cloud offering, Anthos, along with integrations with over 30 hardware, software and system integration partners including Cisco, VMware, HPE, Intel, and Lenovo. Still, analysts expect a lot more to come from Kurian and GCP over the coming quarters, especially in regards to fine-tuning the company's efforts to reach more customers. ""Google continues to make strides to commercialize its enterprise cloud platform (GCP),"" Baird's Sebastian wrote. ""We expect improving momentum as the company updates its go-to-market strategy with improved sales and support."" Ives believes a significant part of GCP's growth strategy will come by way of acquisitions. ""I think this is all a drumroll to significant M&A for cloud for Google over the next six to nine months,"" Ives said. ""Kurian is a serial acquirer from Oracle. They did not bring him over to sit at a desk and do powerpoints at user conferences."" Got a tip?

On IUnicorn's Weibo page, the company shared its  new campaign calling out Tesla for bad quality control in China. It also rolled out several large Times Square billboards as part of the campaign. Here's what the billboards looked like, according to the company's posts. Quartz reports that the messages were only up for 30 minutes. It's unclear why the notices were pulled so quickly. Quartz also reports that the company rented three billboards asking for nearly $1 million from Tesla for lengthy repair time on 20 percent of the ride-hailing company's 278 Tesla vehicles it purchased over the past few years. Quartz reports the company flagged electromechanical issues and 3.5 million minutes the cars were unavailable because of repairs. The messages roughly translate to: ""Tesla, fix it or not,"" ""Tesla, pay us or not,"" and ""Tesla, admit it or not.""

The first leg of the FINA Champions Series, the sport's richest event to date, was held in Guangzhou, China on Saturday and Sunday. The event came as the governing body, one of the richest in the world, faced increased pressure with swimmers demanding better pay. Campbell, who lead the charge for increased prize money,  pocketed the biggest pay cheque for two freestyle events and one butterfly race, The Daily Telegraph reported. Olympic swimming legend Cate Campbell earned a staggering $851,118 for her appearance in the sport's richest event to date after demanding better pay Emily Seebohm, who battled a bout of food poisoning over the weekend, was able to pocket $25,500 for her stint in the pool The 26-year-old's hourly rate from the event would be higher than Tesla boss Elon Musk who is on $684,931 an hour, Microsoft founder Bill Gates who earns $456,621 an hour, and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey who pockets $205,479 according to Business Insider. Emily Seebohm, who battled a bout of food poisoning during the meet, walked away with $25,500 for her stint in the pool. Jack McLoughlin won himself $8,500 for his third place result in the 400-metre freestyle, which was won by native Olympic champion Sun Yang. FINA covered all travel and accommodation expenses for the event, with more than $1.13million alone spent on appearance fees for the invite-only competition. The series was organised in response to the $7.7million International Swimming League (ISL) which will be launched later in the year. A number of Australian swimmers declined invitations to the series, including Kyle Chalmers and Mack Horton. The three competing Australians will not continue on to the second and third leg of the series as the races are too close to the national trials for the world titles. However, Seebohm said she saw the event, which only hosted four swimmers per race, as a good warm up for future endeavours. The first leg of the FINA Champions Series, held on Saturday and Sunday in Guangzhou, China, welcomed some of the pool's best for the lucrative invite-only event 'This year is about taking chances and doing different things so when the FINA series came up I was very interested in racing people I will be up against in the next couple of years (at Tokyo 2020),' Seebohm told AAP. FINA has been under fire from professional swimmers about how it spends its mass wealth. Between 2013 and 2016, it raked in $266million but only spend 16 per cent of its expenditure on prize money. FINA threatened to ban swimmers from the 2022 Olympics in Tokyo if they joined the ISL, where they would earn a greater cut of money. FINA has been under fire from professional swimmers about how it spends its mass wealth It led to a lawsuit before FINA quickly backtracked and offered the Champions Series to the elite swimmers. 'FINA is not supporting us, they are putting swimmers at the bottom of their priority list,' Campbell told The Daily Telegraph in December 2018. 'I can guarantee that just about any athlete in the world would have said that this ISL is a good thing and good opportunity to grow swimming globally but FINA's worried that it's going to cut down on their revenue.'

The company plans to announce on Tuesday that it has started selling solar panels and related equipment for up to 16 percent less than the national average price by standardizing systems and requiring customers to order them online. Tesla executives said these changes should put to rest concerns that the company, better known for its luxury electric cars, has neglected its residential solar business. But it is not clear whether the strategy will work or is even feasible. Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have struggled to deliver products on time that they announced with great fanfare, including a $35,000 version of its Model 3 electric sedan. The company has also struggled with quality problems. Last week, Tesla reported a $702 million loss in the first quarter as deliveries of cars and solar systems tumbled. The company’s stock price is down by more than 27 percent so far this year, and many analysts believe it will soon need to raise money by selling shares or bonds because its cash holdings dropped by about $1.5 billion in the first three months of the year. The solar industry is known for intense competition and low profit margins. In the first three months of the year, Tesla fell to third place behind Sunrun and Vivint Solar in installations, according to a preliminary analysis by Wood Mackenzie, a research and consulting firm. Sanjay Shah, who runs Tesla’s solar business and previously worked at Dell and Amazon, said solar companies, his included, have struggled to make money because they have made buying solar panels too complex. Most installers develop and sell solar systems that are customized for each home. “We spent hours and hours and days and days on the process,” Mr. Shah said. “It adds cost. It adds time. We needed to have a very streamlined process.” He said Tesla would now offer systems only in increments of 4 kilowatts, a measure of how much electricity the panels can generate in ideal conditions, or 12 panels. The average system in the United States can generate about 7.6 kilowatts of power. To further reduce costs and complexity, customers will be asked to do many of the tasks Tesla employees used to do. Homeowners will photograph electric meters, circuit breaker boxes and other equipment and send the images to the company, reducing the need for site visits. As a result of these changes, Mr. Shah said Tesla customers could expect to pay $1.75 to $1.99 per watt after a federal tax incentive, depending on where they live. The average residential solar customer pays $2.08 per watt after the tax break, including $1 for permitting and inspections, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. “It’s not sexy to talk about, but soft costs are kind of the biggest barrier to getting the next level of costs down,” said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association. “If they’ve come up with some new ways to lower soft costs, that would be a game changer.” Allison Mond, a senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said most solar companies had been automating tasks like using online digital images to assess customers’ roofs, but Tesla’s new approach had the potential to reduce labor costs substantially more than what other companies had achieved. Mr. Musk pushed Tesla into the solar business by acquiring SolarCity in November 2016, arguing that it would fit naturally into the company’s mission of providing sustainable transportation and energy. Some investors said Tesla was paying too much for SolarCity, which was founded by two of Mr. Musk’s cousins. Since the acquisition closed, Tesla has struggled to expand the solar business or even figure out its strategy. In February 2018, the company said it would sell panels in 800 Home Depot stores. But in June of that year, Tesla said it was ending that partnership because it wanted to sell solar systems online and in its own stores. Mr. Musk also promised to replace the boxy solar panels with solar shingles that look like ordinary roofing materials but can generate electricity. More than two years since he made that announcement in late 2016, Tesla has mostly taken reservations for that product. Mr. Shah said the company hoped to push sales of those shingles, which Tesla calls a “solar roof,” in the second half of this year. Tesla’s struggles with the solar business mirror its larger financial problems. After weak car sales caused the company to lose money in the first quarter, the company said it did not expect to turn a profit until the third quarter of this year. In January, Mr. Musk said that he was “optimistic” that the company would be profitable every quarter. The company has said its financial results would improve this year as it overcomes the logistical problems of getting cars to Europe and China. But Tesla’s large first-quarter loss has revived concerns among investors that the company is not making enough money to finance its operations and expand. Tesla’s solar business had a particularly bleak first quarter during which revenue plunged 21 percent compared with the same period a year earlier. The division’s gross profit was just 2.4 percent of revenue, down from 8.5 percent a year earlier. The company said the changes it was making to its solar business should help revive sales and profits. Tesla produces solar products at a factory in Buffalo. As part of a pact with New York State that included significant subsidies, Tesla has to comply with certain hiring and investment requirements. In a financial filing on Monday, Tesla said it expected to meet those targets on time, but added that failure to do so could obligate the company to pay “significant amounts” to the state. Mr. Shah said he was optimistic about Tesla’s chances, pointing out that just two million homes nationally, or about 3 percent of the total, have solar panels today. More people will adopt solar energy as they realize that the panels pay for themselves over time in the form of lower electricity bills and sales of electricity to local utilities. “It’s practically a money-printing machine on their roofs,” Mr. Shah said.",tesla looks regain luster solar energy slashing prices,tesla lost status nation leading rooftop solar company last year says figured get back game slashing prices company plans announce tuesday started selling solar panels related equipment percent less national average price standardizing systems requiring customers order online tesla executives said changes put rest concerns company better known luxury electric cars neglected residential solar business clear whether strategy work even feasible tesla chief executive elon musk struggled deliver products time announced great fanfare including version model electric sedan company also struggled quality problems last week tesla reported million loss first quarter deliveries cars solar systems tumbled company stock price percent far year many analysts believe soon need raise money selling shares bonds cash holdings dropped billion first three months year solar industry known intense competition low profit margins first three months year tesla fell third place behind sunrun vivint solar installations according preliminary analysis wood mackenzie research consulting firm sanjay shah runs tesla solar business previously worked dell amazon said solar companies included struggled make money made buying solar panels complex installers develop sell solar systems customized home spent hours hours days days process shah said adds cost adds time needed streamlined said tesla would offer systems increments kilowatts measure much electricity panels generate ideal conditions panels average system united states generate kilowatts power reduce costs complexity customers asked many tasks tesla employees used homeowners photograph electric meters circuit breaker boxes equipment send images company reducing need site visits result changes shah said tesla customers could expect pay per watt federal tax incentive depending live average residential solar customer pays per watt tax break including permitting inspections according solar energy industries association sexy talk soft costs kind biggest barrier getting next level costs said bernadette del chiaro executive director california solar storage association come new ways lower soft costs would game allison mond senior analyst wood mackenzie said solar companies automating tasks like using online digital images assess customers roofs tesla new approach potential reduce labor costs substantially companies achieved musk pushed tesla solar business acquiring solarcity november arguing would fit naturally company mission providing sustainable transportation energy investors said tesla paying much solarcity founded two musk cousins since acquisition closed tesla struggled expand solar business even figure strategy february company said would sell panels home depot stores june year tesla said ending partnership wanted sell solar systems online stores musk also promised replace boxy solar panels solar shingles look like ordinary roofing materials generate electricity two years since made announcement late tesla mostly taken reservations product shah said company hoped push sales shingles tesla calls solar roof second half year tesla struggles solar business mirror larger financial problems weak car sales caused company lose money first quarter company said expect turn profit third quarter year january musk said optimistic company would profitable every quarter company said financial results would improve year overcomes logistical problems getting cars europe china tesla large loss revived concerns among investors company making enough money finance operations expand tesla solar business particularly bleak first quarter revenue plunged percent compared period year earlier division gross profit percent revenue percent year earlier company said changes making solar business help revive sales profits tesla produces solar products factory buffalo part pact new york state included significant subsidies tesla comply certain hiring investment requirements financial filing monday tesla said expected meet targets time added failure could obligate company pay significant amounts state shah said optimistic tesla chances pointing two million homes nationally percent total solar panels today people adopt solar energy realize panels pay time form lower electricity bills sales electricity local utilities practically machine roofs shah said

But now, Musk has directly (and publicly, on Twitter) asked Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin to explain his vision of the cryptocurrency's future, and it's turning into an interesting discussion. First, it needs to be said that Musk and Buterin are quite similar in certain regards. Both are very active on Twitter. Both are very smart and love talking about complex concepts that will make your head spin. Both love silly jokes, and they regularly drive their users/customers/shareholders up the wall. In 2017, Buterin (who insists he's just one of many cogs inside Ethereum but is largely seen as the project's leader) said he will leave (Ethereum) if its community doesn't get its act together. Musk angered the SEC to the point that he almost lost his CEO position at Tesla. And now, finally, these two are chatting on Twitter. Musk started the conversation in an odd manner, tweeting simply ""Ethereum,"" followed by a tweet indicating he was only kidding. But Buterin took the bait, and invited Musk to Ethereum's Devcon conference in October. Musk replied by asking what should be developed on Ethereum (unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is more than a cryptocurrency; it's a smart contract platform that allows developers to create decentralized apps — dApps — that live on Ethereum's blockchain). Buterin replied by listing some of his ideas as well as some projects that are actively being developed on Ethereum right now. This includes decentralized finance services, identity services, public registries, micropayment-based content services, among others. Check out the entire thread here. So far, Musk hasn't replied to these. But who knows, by the end of the day, these two could be starting a new company together — stranger things have happened.

What have that unlovely lot got in common? They’ve all suffered from financial scandals and they were all audited by KPMG when the scandals occurred. Outside the motorcycling fraternity, the last of those isn’t exactly a household name but it made quite a noise during the past decade until it started to shudder like a bike with a faulty exhaust in 2010. The business, a Lloyd’s of London insurance underwriter, tumbled into the red having failed to set aside sufficient money to deal with a rash of personal injury claims. An investigation was eventually launched into the auditing of the insurer by KPMG in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Ten years on from the last of those audits and an independent tribunal has found misconduct, fining the firm £6m, and both a current and former KPMG partner £100,000 each. The announcement of the penalty represents yet another hit to the reputation of a firm that has taken so many whacks that its PR staff must have been issued with crash helmets. Their job is to defend a brand that now looks barely tarnished. It may yet cause some big companies to ask whether they really want KPMG’s name listed on their roster of advisers, especially at a time when audit committees are facing increased scrutiny. Were the firm to seriously wobble, it would cause a serious problem. The last thing regulators need is for the big four accountancy firms to become a big three, at least in Britain. There’s nothing to really suggest that it’s happening at the moment. But it has to be a risk. Hence the firm’s keenness to show it has changed. The company’s statement in response to the fine described the issue as “historic”, which it is given the audits in question were carried out more than 10 years ago when KPMG was also overseeing the accounts of HBOS, the mortgage bank it signed off as a going concern six months before the financial crisis showed it was anything but.",kpmg hit yet another audit fine firm insists changed,names carillion ted baker hbos bargain booze conviviality insurance claims handler quindell add motorbike insurer equity red star unlovely lot got common suffered financial scandals audited kpmg scandals occurred outside motorcycling fraternity last exactly household name made quite noise past decade started shudder like bike faulty exhaust business lloyd london insurance underwriter tumbled red failed set aside sufficient money deal rash personal injury claims investigation eventually launched auditing insurer kpmg ten years last audits independent tribunal found misconduct fining firm current former kpmg partner announcement penalty represents yet another hit reputation firm taken many whacks pr staff must issued crash helmets job defend brand looks barely tarnished may yet cause big companies ask whether really want kpmg name listed roster advisers especially time audit committees facing increased scrutiny firm seriously wobble would cause serious problem last thing regulators need big four accountancy firms become big three least britain nothing really suggest happening moment risk hence firm keenness show changed company statement response fine described issue historic given audits question carried years ago kpmg also overseeing accounts hbos mortgage bank signed going concern six months financial crisis showed anything

Nick Bostrom, an Oxford philosophy professor, told Business Insider: ""AI is a bigger threat to human existence than climate change. Climate change is not going to be the biggest change we see this century."" He added: ""Climate change is unlikely to bring about a good outcome, but if AI's development turns out badly, it'll be far worse than climate change. AI could turn out really well for humanity, but it could also turn out really badly."" Bostrom is a preeminent thinker in his field, having published books including ""Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies."" He is also unusual in appealing to both sides of the debate: His work has been endorsed by Elon Musk, who has expressed apocalyptic views about AI, and Bill Gates, a cautiously upbeat advocate of the technology. It's why he is careful to qualify his comparison to climate change, a force that could damage Earth irrevocably unless humans make radical changes in the next decade. ""The reason that AI is often depicted as evil robots in the media is because it makes for a good story. Robots are more visually compelling than a chip inside a black box; you can see and feel them in a way you can't with a chip,"" he said. ""But malevolence isn't the problem. It's the possibility that AIs might be indifferent to human goals."" All intelligent entities, whether human or artificial, have goals, even if they are preprogrammed. For very simple AI thermometers, for example, it's to successfully measure the temperature. Bostrom's fear is that if AIs become competent enough in pursuit of their goals, even ones that sound harmless, they may inadvertently harm people. In a 2003 paper, Bostrom gave the example of an AI whose only goal is to maximize paper-clip production. If this AI could reprogram itself to improve its intelligence — something some Google-developed AIs are already capable of — it may become so smart that it innovates ways to maximize the number of paper clips it produces. At some point, it might start ""transforming first all of earth and then increasing portions of space into paperclip manufacturing facilities,"" Bostrom wrote. ""Terminator""-style robots might be visually compelling, but Bostrom says they misrepresent the threat posed by artificial intelligence.
Paramount If turning the world into a paper-clip machine sounds idiotic, it's because it doesn't align with humans' goals. But the paper-clip printer is following its aims to a logical conclusion. In becoming so astoundingly good at making paper clips, it could end up harming people. It would not have set out to be malevolent — it's just indifferent to goals beyond its own. The example might sound far-fetched, but Bostrom says AI's indifference to humanity's endeavors could already be a real threat. ""The biggest ways AI is likely to have a negative impact is in information-systems roles, such as selecting news stories that confirm people's prejudices or acting as surveillance systems,"" he said. Problems are already emerging with the latter, prompting questions about whether firms like Amazon and Microsoft should be selling facial-recognition technology to public agencies. The American Civil Liberties Union said last May that Amazon had sold its Rekognition tool to government and police agencies for the purpose of public surveillance and identifying ""people of interest."" The ACLU also found last year that Rekognition incorrectly identified 28 members of Congress as people who had been arrested. For Bostrom, the big challenge is getting AI under control and programming it to align with humans' goals. ""The first set of challenges will be technical, such as finding a way of developing AI in a controlled way,"" he said. ""Assuming we solve that, our next goals are societal challenges about creating a world order that serves the common good."" So does Bostrom think the big tech companies are trying hard enough to develop AI in a controlled way? Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple are at the cutting edge of AI development, and yet some academics think they are not developing AI compatible with humans' goals. Bostrom said the people he'd spoken with at the big tech companies ""do care about making AI safe and compatible"" with those goals. ""I also get some sense that they're not able to figure out how to go about doing this,"" he said. ""It's a lot to expect each tech company to come up with their own ethical framework for controlling AI.""

Google, for example, disbanded an AI ethics board a week after thousands of employees campaigned against the inclusion of Kay Coles James, the president of the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank. Google CEO Sundar Pichai.
Getty But if big technology companies can't be trusted to create frameworks for developing AI ethically and safely, who can? What about governments? Again, Bostrom is skeptical. ""There aren't that many clear policy proposals yet regarding how governments should intervene,"" he said. ""Right now, it's not clear what you'd want governments to do. We have to widen the conversation. ""Capitalism is supposed to function with governments creating the rules of behavior and companies functioning within those rules,"" he said, but ""there's a cultural mismatch between Silicon Valley and governments: Silicon Valley has a libertarian-leaning ethos, where governments are behind the curve and not entrepreneurial."" He added: ""I do think there will be a need for government to have more people who understand AI — not necessarily brilliant researchers, but people with enough of a background, like a master's degree in computer science. The ability to understand AI comes in degrees. Sometimes it's better to not be too much of a specialist, because if you're too specialized, you can have a narrow view of a field's wider societal ramifications."" Bostrom, however, thinks he can shape the conversation around AI while remaining in academia. He also said activist employees, such as those at Google, were playing their part in holding their companies to account. ""There are things that AI researchers can do to influence the behavior of big tech companies without having to leave academia,"" he said. ""There is also a degree of public activism within AI research communities anyway, such as the recent Google uprising.""",ai greater threat human existence climate change says oxford professor endorsed bill gates,one world leading thinkers artificial intelligence says technology bigger menace civilization climate change nick bostrom oxford philosophy professor told business insider ai bigger threat human existence climate change climate change going biggest change see century added climate change unlikely bring good outcome ai development turns badly far worse climate change ai could turn really well humanity could also turn really badly bostrom preeminent thinker field published books including superintelligence paths dangers strategies also unusual appealing sides debate work endorsed elon musk expressed apocalyptic views ai bill gates cautiously upbeat advocate technology careful qualify comparison climate change force could damage earth irrevocably unless humans make radical changes next decade reason ai often depicted evil robots media makes good story robots visually compelling chip inside black box see feel way ca chip said malevolence problem possibility ais might indifferent human goals intelligent entities whether human artificial goals even preprogrammed simple ai thermometers example successfully measure temperature bostrom fear ais become competent enough pursuit goals even ones sound harmless may inadvertently harm people paper bostrom gave example ai whose goal maximize production ai could reprogram improve intelligence something ais already capable may become smart innovates ways maximize number paper clips produces point might start transforming first earth increasing portions space paperclip manufacturing facilities bostrom wrote terminator robots might visually compelling bostrom says misrepresent threat posed artificial intelligence paramount turning world machine sounds idiotic align humans goals printer following aims logical conclusion becoming astoundingly good making paper clips could end harming people would set malevolent indifferent goals beyond example might sound bostrom says ai indifference humanity endeavors could already real threat biggest ways ai likely negative impact roles selecting news stories confirm people prejudices acting surveillance systems said problems already emerging latter prompting questions whether firms like amazon microsoft selling technology public agencies american civil liberties union said last may amazon sold rekognition tool government police agencies purpose public surveillance identifying people interest aclu also found last year rekognition incorrectly identified members congress people arrested bostrom big challenge getting ai control programming align humans goals first set challenges technical finding way developing ai controlled way said assuming solve next goals societal challenges creating world order serves common good bostrom think big tech companies trying hard enough develop ai controlled way google amazon facebook apple cutting edge ai development yet academics think developing ai compatible humans goals bostrom said people spoken big tech companies care making ai safe compatible goals also get sense able figure go said lot expect tech company come ethical framework controlling ai read employee backlash google cancelled ai ethics board little week announcing tech firms visibly grappling issue google example disbanded ai ethics board week thousands employees campaigned inclusion kay coles james president heritage foundation think tank google ceo sundar pichai getty big technology companies ca trusted create frameworks developing ai ethically safely governments bostrom skeptical many clear policy proposals yet regarding governments intervene said right clear want governments widen conversation capitalism supposed function governments creating rules behavior companies functioning within rules said cultural mismatch silicon valley governments silicon valley ethos governments behind curve entrepreneurial added think need government people understand ai necessarily brilliant researchers people enough background like master degree computer science ability understand ai comes degrees sometimes better much specialist specialized narrow view field wider societal ramifications bostrom however thinks shape conversation around ai remaining academia also said activist employees google playing part holding companies account things ai researchers influence behavior big tech companies without leave academia said also degree public activism within ai research communities anyway recent google uprising

The latest figures from regulator Ofcom show that just over one in six Britons are dissatisfied with the people they pay good money to keep them online. That represents a modest improvement - the overall level of satisfaction was at 83 per cent vs 80 per cent last time. But it's worth pointing out that a supermarket group getting that sort of score would be in a panic. In a highly competitive sector, it's the sort of thing that could drive them out of business. And the improvement certainly isn’t anything to shout about when put in the context of how important the service has become and the impact that the poor performance of broadband providers can have on individuals and their businesses. The regulator has correctly recognised that action is necessary to correct their collective failure. The regular publication of the figures is a part of that, but it has also recently taken more concrete steps. Perhaps its most important reform is the demand that firms automatically compensate customers when they suffer outages or are hit with delays. This also applies if engineers schedule appointments and don’t turn up. Customers are being given more and better information about the speeds they can expect when they sign up, and the power to walk away form contracts if they have a problem. All this means that firms that fail to shape up could find themselves facing a significant financial penalty. Bad news for TalkTalk in particular. It again found itself at the bottom of the service league table. Ofcom also wants to show its charges a carrot as well as a stick. It hopes that firms scoring more highly will be rewarded with more business. But do people look at Ofcom’s scores and factor them in when choosing a broadband provider? Is there enough differentiation between the firms at the top and those at the bottom to have a meaningful impact on the business they bring in? The figures would suggest otherwise and the industry’s fairly dismal reputation may serve to put people off switching full stop.

After getting a $600 million injection from mobile gaming company The9 Limited, Faraday announced that it has scored another $225 million in bridge financing via a funding round led by Birch Lake Associates. The cash will be used to bring the company flagship FF91 EV to market and reassure jittery suppliers that the company is still on sound footing. ""As part of the vendor program, Birch Lake has also provided financing to FF for the company to pay all past due amounts for approximately 60 percent of FF's vendor base, including smaller vendors who are owed less than $20,000,"" the company wrote. Meanwhile, larger suppliers will be able to exchange unsecured debt for ""trust interests"" that will include a repayment schedule. To secure the financing, Faraday said it valued its intellectual property at $1.25 billion. The company plans to use The9's cash to build the V9 EV, a version of the Faraday FF91 for the Chinese market. It has promised to build 300,000 of the EVs per year by 2020, and said it has a growing fleet of FF91 pre-production test vehicles. Behind the scenes, FF continues its work on its preproduction test vehicles. With its growing fleet of preproduction vehicles being used as a testbed for cloud-connectivity, software releases and other validation measures, the engineering team has made steady progress to finalize FF 91 for production. However, it's hard to take that seriously considering that Tesla only cracked 300,000 deliveries last year and has been in business since 2003 (and doing so almost broke CEO Elon Musk). That's on top of the fact that Faraday had to sell its LA headquarters for $10 million to stay afloat, and put its $40 million Las Vegas property -- where the FF91 was to be built -- up for sale. It has lost many of its key senior executives and earlier this year, failed to raise the cash needed to bring back furloughed workers. Finally, CEO Jia Yueting is facing lawsuits over debt issues with his other companies, including LeEco. However, despite its problems and lack of success building vehicles, it shows that the company still has a talent for finding new investors.",faraday future ev dreams live another bailout,faraday future parted ways last partner chinese real estate firm evergrande money seems flowing getting million injection mobile gaming company limited faraday announced scored another million bridge financing via funding round led birch lake associates cash used bring company flagship ev market reassure jittery suppliers company still sound footing part vendor program birch lake also provided financing ff company pay past due amounts approximately percent ff vendor base including smaller vendors owed less company wrote meanwhile larger suppliers able exchange unsecured debt trust interests include repayment schedule secure financing faraday said valued intellectual property billion company plans use cash build ev version faraday chinese market promised build evs per year said growing fleet test vehicles behind scenes ff continues work preproduction test vehicles growing fleet preproduction vehicles used testbed software releases validation measures engineering team made steady progress finalize ff production however hard take seriously considering tesla cracked deliveries last year business since almost broke ceo elon musk top fact faraday sell la headquarters million stay afloat put million las vegas property built sale lost many key senior executives earlier year failed raise cash needed bring back furloughed workers finally ceo jia yueting facing lawsuits debt issues companies including leeco however despite problems lack success building vehicles shows company still talent finding new investors

But investors didn't need to be surprised — they could have made an educated guess the deal was coming since this past weekend, when a corporate jet tracker spotted an Occidental plane landing in Omaha. Reports began surfacing in recent days that the Occidental Gulfstream plane was a sign Buffett might be preparing a bid in the hostile war between Chevron and Occidental over Anadarko, a Permian Basin driller seen as a key prize in an era of shale consolidation. Analyst Don Bilson of independent research firm Gordon Haskett Research Advisors sent a note to his clients on Monday citing information from Quandl, which tracks corporate jet activity and other alternative sources of data important to the markets. Bloomberg cited information on Monday from FlightAirMap showing the Gulfstream jet was in Omaha on Sunday. Haskett's Monday note, titled, ""What was Occidental doing in Omaha?"" came as Occidental was formalizing its counter-bid to Chevron's deal. It stated, ""Here is where it gets a little more interesting. Warren Buffett does not show up as a holder of OXY or APC or CVX. And a quick search of OXY's 10-K for 'Nebraska' turns up nothing. Yet for some reason, an OXY jet was seen in Omaha yesterday. That strikes us as an odd trip for OXY to make, especially on a Sunday and while it is engaged in a high-stakes M&A battle. While we can't say what OXY might have been doing in Omaha yesterday, it has occurred to us that it might be trying to bring Buffett into this deal and help with the cash portion of its offer. We have assumed that OXY could go higher than $76 and if it really has paid Buffett a visit, we suspect it is gearing up to top CVX's inevitable bump. This mention comes with the standard caveat that Corporate Jet information can be noisy and difficult to read."" On Tuesday, Gordon Haskett analyst Bilson wrote to clients, ""It pays to keep track of those tail numbers!"" Alternative sources of information have been used for years by hedge funds to stay ahead of the competition. Drones have flown over mall parking lots to track retail traffic, as well as operations at battleground stocks like Tesla to keep a tabs on production and deliveries. Tracking corporate planes as an M&A indicator was popular in the 1990s, but companies began masking planes as a result. An FAA decision in 2011 to open up records on private plane flights led to renewed interest in the tactic. In 2017, hedge funds made winning bets using Johnson & Johnson corporate jet flight information before it acquired Actelion.

Smart cars, with their unique styling and ability to fit in half a parking space, found an audience in densely populated U.S. and Canadian cities. But that audience was small and rapidly declining. Canadian sales of Smart vehicles fell 6.3 per cent to just 345 units in 2018 after the car went fully electric. U.S. Smart sales in 2018 were 1,276, a drop of 58 per cent. The Smart brand's electric cars offered just 93 kilometres of driving range. Competing models such as the ""mid-range"" Tesla Model 3, with an estimated range of 523 kilometres, offered more range and more room for passengers and cargo. Daimler ended sales of gasoline-fuelled Smart cars in 2017. The cars were used by the Car2Go car-sharing service which pulled out of the Toronto market last year because of difficulties with parking. The car-sharing service now operates in other Canadian cities, including Vancouver and Calgary, under the name Share Now. Small car sales to consumers have suffered because of relatively cheap gasoline and a preference for larger trucks and sport utility vehicles. Daimler's Mercedes-Benz brand, in a statement, cited ""a number of factors"" for the decision to end Smart's run in the United States and Canada, ""including a declining micro-car market in the U.S. and Canada, combined with the costs required to bring the European-designed Smart in line with North American regulations. Mercedes plans to bring new, larger electric vehicles to the United States, starting with the launch of the EQC sport utility next year. Those vehicles will help Mercedes meet zero emission vehicle quotas in California and other states. Mercedes dealers will still offer parts and repairs for Smart cars, the company said. Daimler has said it will enter into a joint venture with Zhejiang Geely Holding Group to build a new generation of Smart models in a purpose-built electric-car factory in China with global sales to begin in 2022.",daimler pull smart cars canada market,tiny smart cars pitched next big thing urban mobility discontinued united states canada end current model year german automaker daimler ag said monday smart cars unique styling ability fit half parking space found audience densely populated canadian cities audience small rapidly declining canadian sales smart vehicles fell per cent units car went fully electric smart sales drop per cent smart brand electric cars offered kilometres driving range competing models tesla model estimated range kilometres offered range room passengers cargo daimler ended sales smart cars cars used service pulled toronto market last year difficulties parking service operates canadian cities including vancouver calgary name share small car sales consumers suffered relatively cheap gasoline preference larger trucks sport utility vehicles daimler brand statement cited number factors decision end smart run united states canada including declining market canada combined costs required bring smart line north american regulations mercedes plans bring new larger electric vehicles united states starting launch eqc sport utility next year vehicles help mercedes meet zero emission vehicle quotas california states mercedes dealers still offer parts repairs smart cars company said daimler said enter joint venture zhejiang geely holding group build new generation smart models factory china global sales begin

""Our residential customers can now purchase solar and energy storage directly from our website, in standardized increments of capacity,"" the company wrote. Further Reading
Residential solar is cheap, but can it get cheaper? Paths to $0.05 per kWh
Now, the New York Times is reporting that Tesla intends to slash solar panel prices today, with Tesla Senior Vice President of Energy Operations Sanjay Shah telling the paper that ""Tesla customers could expect to pay $1.75 to $1.99 per watt, depending on where they live"" after a federal tax break. The Solar Energy Industries Association says the average cost of residential solar panels is currently $2.85 per watt, or $2.08 per watt with the federal tax break included. Tesla's plan to undercut its competitors is ostensibly possible because the company is eliminating many so-called ""soft costs"" of solar panel installation. Instead of sending contractors out to a house to design and optimize a solar panel installation, customers will now order solar panels online, in preset increments of power. Each increment will be able to produce 4 kilowatts (kW) of power with 12 panels. The Times reports that ""To further reduce costs and complexity, customers will be asked to do many of the tasks Tesla employees used to do. Homeowners will photograph electric meters, circuit breaker boxes and other equipment and send the images to the company, reducing the need for site visits."" Ars Technica has contacted Tesla for confirmation of this report, and we'll update if we receive a response. In 2018, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) released a paper saying that the biggest barrier to reducing residential solar panel prices was bringing down the soft costs that Tesla appears to be targeting. Soft costs are accrued as supply chain costs, labor costs, and sales and marketing costs—basically anything that doesn't pertain to the physical construction of the solar panel itself. Since Tesla acquired SolarCity years ago, it has been aggressive about cutting sales and marketing costs. Tesla discontinued SolarCity's door-to-door marketing, it closed a number of SolarCity installation locations, and it discontinued a partnership with Home Depot. But those costs also had a return: they brought customers into the fold. So while Tesla cut solar costs, quarter after quarter it lost market share to SunRun and other major US solar companies. Meanwhile, Tesla has been trying to get a massive solar factory in Buffalo, New York, up to full speed. The factory is intended to churn out not just solar panels but also the promised ""solar roof"" tiles that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has hyped for years. But last summer Reuters reported that Tesla and its partner Panasonic were experiencing assembly line issues, and Tesla says it won't ramp up solar roof installation until later this year. In Buffalo, Tesla has a hiring quota that it must reach this year to satisfy local government agreements. Tesla says it expects to meet the quota. Correction: The story originally reported that Tesla planned to slash costs by 38 percent, but this included a federal tax break that Tesla customers would receive, while the comparable costs national average costs per watt did not include the federal tax break.",report tesla slash solar panel prices stymie market share loss,tesla financial statement last week company said would revitalize sluggish solar panel sales streamlining purchase process residential customers purchase solar energy storage directly website standardized increments capacity company wrote reading residential solar cheap get cheaper paths per kwh new york times reporting tesla intends slash solar panel prices today tesla senior vice president energy operations sanjay shah telling paper tesla customers could expect pay per watt depending live federal tax break solar energy industries association says average cost residential solar panels currently per watt per watt federal tax break included tesla plan undercut competitors ostensibly possible company eliminating many soft costs solar panel installation instead sending contractors house design optimize solar panel installation customers order solar panels online preset increments power increment able produce kilowatts kw power panels times reports reduce costs complexity customers asked many tasks tesla employees used homeowners photograph electric meters circuit breaker boxes equipment send images company reducing need site visits ars technica contacted tesla confirmation report update receive response national renewable energy laboratory nrel released paper saying biggest barrier reducing residential solar panel prices bringing soft costs tesla appears targeting soft costs accrued supply chain costs labor costs sales marketing anything pertain physical construction solar panel since tesla acquired solarcity years ago aggressive cutting sales marketing costs tesla discontinued solarcity marketing closed number solarcity installation locations discontinued partnership home depot costs also return brought customers fold tesla cut solar costs quarter quarter lost market share sunrun major us solar companies meanwhile tesla trying get massive solar factory buffalo new york full speed factory intended churn solar panels also promised solar roof tiles tesla ceo elon musk hyped years last summer reuters reported tesla partner panasonic experiencing assembly line issues tesla says wo ramp solar roof installation later year buffalo tesla hiring quota must reach year satisfy local government agreements tesla says expects meet quota correction story originally reported tesla planned slash costs percent included federal tax break tesla customers would receive comparable costs national average costs per watt include federal tax break

""There is a clear winner in electrification,"" Palihapitiya said in an interview Tuesday on CNBC. ""It is done. That die has been cast. Now the question is: Can [CEO Elon Musk] build the infrastructure? If given time and given patience I believe that he will."" People are focusing too closely on the ""window dressing"" of Musk's behavior and not enough on the ""main course,"" which is Tesla itself and its competitiveness in the marketplace, he said. He compared Tesla competitors, such as Audi's new electric offering, to the Zune media player, a failed Microsoft competitor to Apple's iPod. ""If you get caught up in all this stuff around the edges — he may mistweet from time to time,"" Palihapitiya said, alluding to Musk's tweets about Tesla production numbers and funding, which have gotten him in hot water with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ""My point is, who cares? Your job as a smart investor is to separate the facts and the news from the fiction and the noise."" Palihapitiya said he continues to hold Tesla stock because Musk has been able to deliver on promises on a larger scale years down the line. Musk's misbehavior on Twitter and podcasts isn't important, he said, because demand for Tesla cars is strong and exceeds other players in the electric-car market. ""All of that stuff doesn't matter. It doesn't change the fact that tens of thousands of consumers are buying that car faster than they can get their hands on it. It doesn't change that as soon as you sit inside that car, your definition of what is expected is altered forever,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, whether you like his style or not, his substance is irrefutable,"" Palihapitiya said of Musk. ""People are betting against his style. Betting against entrepreneurs who are changing the world has never been a profitable endeavor.""

Experts say he's probably wrong. (TSLA),"In recent weeks, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made and detailed the extraordinary claim that Tesla vehicles will defy the laws of the automotive market by becoming more valuable after customers purchase them. ""If you buy a Tesla today, I believe you are buying an appreciating asset, not a depreciating asset,"" Musk said during an interview with MIT research scientist Lex Fridman. Musk's prediction is based on two assumptions: Tesla vehicles will be able to drive themselves without any human input by the end of 2019, and customers will be able to make money from their vehicles by including them in an autonomous ride-hailing service Musk says will be ready next year. Read more: Elon Musk's prediction that it will have a robo-taxi service ready by the end of 2020 is a 'publicity stunt,' an expert says Still, Musk's claim that Tesla vehicles sold today will command higher prices in the future is unusual, because, in almost all cases, a car begins losing value the moment it is driven off a dealership's lot. According to AAA, cars lose around 15%-20% of their value each year. Only in very rare cases does a car's value increase after it is sold, said Eric Ibara, the director of residual value consulting for Kelley Blue Book. While automotive CEOs may predict that a car's value will hold up better than its competitors', they do not tend to claim that their vehicles will become more valuable over time. ""I don't remember any CEO claiming that the value would go up,"" Ibara said. Of course, Musk's prediction rests on technology that has no precedent in the auto industry. Previous generations of automotive CEOs have not faced the prospect of autonomous taxi services that can allow customers to make money from their vehicles when they're not using them. But even if Musk is correct about his timeline for the introduction of Tesla's autonomous-driving technology, it's not clear that Tesla vehicles purchased today would become more valuable in the future. Some components, like brakes, batteries, and lights, would still wear down, and others, like seats and door handles, would wear down faster due to the increased use they would receive from ride-hailing customers, said Sam Abuelsamid, a senior research analyst for Navigant Research. ""Except for the engine, everything that has wear-and-tear on a gasoline or diesel-engine car is still there on an electric vehicle and still wears out,"" Abuelsamid said. Physical deterioration aside, Tesla would have to be the only automaker with self-driving technology that required no human supervision for its vehicles to have a chance of becoming more valuable, Ibara said. Given the level of competition Tesla faces in the autonomous-vehicle industry, that's unlikely. ""A lot of other manufacturers and non-automotive companies are rushing into this area, so the scenario where Tesla has this capability all to themselves is a little far-fetched,"" Ibara said. But that's exactly what Musk has predicted, saying he believes that Tesla is far ahead of its competitors in the race to develop fully-autonomous driving technology. ""I could be wrong, but it appears to be the case that Tesla is vastly ahead of everyone,"" Musk said during his interview with Fridman. Musk has missed projections about autonomous-driving technology on multiple occasions. In 2015, he said it would ready in about two years, and Tesla has passed multiple deadlines set by Musk to send a self-driving vehicle across the US. ""People like me, we roll our eyes when we hear claims like this from Tesla,"" said Ragunathan Rajkumar, a co-director of Carnegie Mellon's Connected and Autonomous Driving Collaborative Research Lab, about Musk's recent prediction. Fully-autonomous driving technology is likely a minimum of eight years away, and it is highly unlikely that Tesla or any other company will have self-driving consumer vehicles ready by the end of this year, Rajkumar said. Among the biggest obstacles Tesla faces has nothing to do with complicated software: Its cars have no mechanism to clean the cameras, radar, and ultrasonic sensors that comprise the company's autonomous-hardware suite, Abuelsamid said. ""They don't have anything on their cars to keep the sensors clean,"" he said, which means that, even if Tesla developed fully-autonomous driving software, the company's vehicles would only be able to drive themselves in favorable weather and environmental conditions. Otherwise, the sensors could become covered with dirt, snow, or debris and have trouble detecting objects around them. And Tesla's system, which leans heavily on cameras and does not include the lidar sensors — which emit pulses of light to detect nearby objects — that many of the company's competitors use, could also have problems when visibility is limited. ""A camera-based system is not going to work on a foggy day,"" Abuelsamid said. Like Rajkumar, Abuelsamid said no company is likely to have fully-autonomous driving technology ready for consumer vehicles by the end of this year, and there's only a small chance that a company will be able to operate an autonomous ride-hailing service with no safety drivers, even in a limited geographic area under certain weather conditions, in a that timeframe, though the Google spin-off Waymo and the General Motors-backed Cruise are in the best position to do so. ""If there's anyone that's close to it, it's probably Waymo and maybe GM/Cruise, but even they are not there yet, and they will tell you that,"" Abuelsamid said. ""That's why they still have human safety drivers."" Tesla did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this story. Have you worked for Tesla? Do you have a story to share?

Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield's Garden State Plaza mall in Paramus, New Jersey — considered one of the top 10 shopping malls in the U.S. based on sales — is being renovated to include office space, a residential area, more food options, a space for gym operators and yoga studios, a hotel and an open green space for the surrounding community to use. This mall sees more than 20 million visitors per year and is considered one of the more productive assets in Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield's portfolio of 92 centers, across a dozen countries, today. The real estate investment trust also owns Westfield Century City in Los Angeles, and Westfield World Trade Center in New York. Unibail-Rodamco, Europe's largest commercial landlord, bought mall owner Westfield last year. ""What people are asking from the mall is much more,"" than what it was just four years ago, Unibail-Rodamco-Westield's U.S. president Jean-Marie Tritant said. ""People want convenience ... to be able to socialize."" American shopping malls tend to be ""much more enclosed"" and ""a little bit like bunkers,"" he added. ""Now we need to connect them to the local environment."" Mall owners across the country realize consumers' preferences are changing. More people are turning to the internet to buy apparel and furniture. And when they do venture out to shop, they want to stumble across unique experiences and good food. That's as retailers left and right are shutting hundreds of stores, big and small, forcing mall owners to get creative with the empty spaces or risk their properties becoming irrelevant. More than 6,000 store closures have already been announced by U.S. retailers in 2019, topping all of 2018. And there are estimated to be about 1,100 malls across America, arguably too many. ""Hundreds of store closures — particularly of large department stores — are accelerating the transformation of malls, forcing landlords to re-tenant an unusually large portion of their centers,"" commercial real estate services firm Green Street Advisors' analyst DJ Busch said in a research note. ""A center's ability to attract good tenants is being tested more than ever."" Green Street has estimated there are currently almost 800 vacant anchor spaces at U.S. shopping malls. As part of the ongoing renovations at Garden State Plaza, a former J.C. Penney store within the mall and a freestanding Best Buy store on the property are being gutted for new uses. Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield said this year it will begin remodeling the inside of the center to add more chef-backed eateries, entertainment for families and health-and-wellness tenants. The unveiling of the new residential space, office building, hotel, public park and open green space will come in 2022, it said. ""When you bring additional food and entertainment ... what happens is you increase the dwell time,"" of shoppers at the mall, Tritant said. ""The dwell time is much higher ... and a consequence of that is people spend more."" Garden State Plaza is anchored by department store chains Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Macy's and Lord & Taylor today. And while the mall includes luxury retailers like Louis Vuitton and Tiffany, it's also managed to attract so-called digitally native brands like glasses maker Warby Parker, shirt retailer Untuckit, athleisure company Fabletics and cosmetics chain Riley Rose to open up stores there. Related-owned Hudson Yards in New York is another development mimicking this so-called mall of the future model, with places to live, work, dine and shop, and with an entire floor dedicated to online brands. Still, there's not a ton of evidence yet that supports the idea that bringing ""experiential"" tenants to malls will amplify activity there. A recent study by Thasos Group found malls with so-called experiential tenants that aren't just focused on selling products — like Apple, Italian food hall Eataly and Tesla — haven't been drawing in extra traffic. Up until the final three months of 2018, indoor shopping malls with ""experiential"" tenants didn't benefit from greater shopper traffic on a year-over-year basis when compared with indoor malls without any of those unique, nonapparel tenants, Thasos said. But there is evidence that when mall owners make additions like office space and apartments to their properties, sales per square foot — a key metric monitored by analysts in the industry — increase significantly. Macerich, one of the few publicly traded mall owners to disclose the sales-per-square-foot metric for each of its assets, has transformed Tysons Corner Center in Virginia to include a 1.5-acre outdoor plaza for events, a 22-floor office tower, a 28-story residential apartment tower and a Hyatt-operated hotel. Tysons Corner has gone from bringing in $645 in sales per square foot in 2009 to nearly $1,000 by the end of 2017, BTIG REIT analyst Jim Sullivan said. ""In making some of these assets mixed use ... you have really dramatic growth in productivity."" Macerich is also one of the first mall owners to begin adding coworking spaces inside its malls, filling space once used by department store chains. Other REITs are trying this, too. Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield added a WeWork at Fulton Center in New York. And Pennsylvania REIT recently added a coworking space to Cherry Hill Mall in New Jersey, the first time it's worked with this type of tenant, with plans for more. The space, called 1776, sits right near Forever 21 and Nordstrom, and can accommodate more than 200 members. Meantime, Simon Property Group, the largest mall owner in the U.S., recently broke ground on its redevelopment of Phipps Plaza mall in Atlanta. It's going to include a Nobu Hotel, a 90,000-square-foot Life Time fitness and entertainment center, and a 13-story office tower, once completed. Simon CEO David Simon just this week spoke to analysts about some of the mall owner's ongoing redevelopments, adding that he ""can't guarantee"" there won't be more shakeout in the retail industry — like store closures and bankruptcies — this year. Later this month, all of these mall owners will come together in Las Vegas at the International Council of Shopping Centers' annual retail real estate conference, the largest gathering for this industry in the world, to discuss how the companies are combating store closures, working with upstart digital brands to open brick-and-mortar stores and more.",sign times one valuable malls america getting makeover,one valuable malls america get total makeover signaling retail evolving include places work workout even live buy clothes garden state plaza mall paramus new jersey considered one top shopping malls based sales renovated include office space residential area food options space gym operators yoga studios hotel open green space surrounding community use mall sees million visitors per year considered one productive assets portfolio centers across dozen countries today real estate investment trust also owns westfield century city los angeles westfield world trade center new york europe largest commercial landlord bought mall owner westfield last year people asking mall much four years ago president tritant said people want convenience able socialize american shopping malls tend much enclosed little bit like bunkers added need connect local environment mall owners across country realize consumers preferences changing people turning internet buy apparel furniture venture shop want stumble across unique experiences good food retailers left right shutting hundreds stores big small forcing mall owners get creative empty spaces risk properties becoming irrelevant store closures already announced retailers topping estimated malls across america arguably many hundreds store closures particularly large department stores accelerating transformation malls forcing landlords unusually large portion centers commercial real estate services firm green street advisors analyst dj busch said research note center ability attract good tenants tested ever green street estimated currently almost vacant anchor spaces shopping malls part ongoing renovations garden state plaza former penney store within mall freestanding best buy store property gutted new uses said year begin remodeling inside center add eateries entertainment families tenants unveiling new residential space office building hotel public park open green space come said bring additional food entertainment happens increase dwell time shoppers mall tritant said dwell time much higher consequence people spend garden state plaza anchored department store chains nordstrom neiman marcus macy lord taylor today mall includes luxury retailers like louis vuitton tiffany also managed attract digitally native brands like glasses maker warby parker shirt retailer untuckit athleisure company fabletics cosmetics chain riley rose open stores hudson yards new york another development mimicking mall future model places live work dine shop entire floor dedicated online brands still ton evidence yet supports idea bringing experiential tenants malls amplify activity recent study thasos group found malls experiential tenants focused selling products like apple italian food hall eataly tesla drawing extra traffic final three months indoor shopping malls experiential tenants benefit greater shopper traffic basis compared indoor malls without unique nonapparel tenants thasos said evidence mall owners make additions like office space apartments properties sales per square foot key metric monitored analysts industry increase significantly macerich one publicly traded mall owners disclose metric assets transformed tysons corner center virginia include outdoor plaza events office tower residential apartment tower hotel tysons corner gone bringing sales per square foot nearly end btig reit analyst jim sullivan said making assets mixed use really dramatic growth productivity macerich also one first mall owners begin adding coworking spaces inside malls filling space used department store chains reits trying added wework fulton center new york pennsylvania reit recently added coworking space cherry hill mall new jersey first time worked type tenant plans space called sits right near forever nordstrom accommodate members meantime simon property group largest mall owner recently broke ground redevelopment phipps plaza mall atlanta going include nobu hotel life time fitness entertainment center office tower completed simon ceo david simon week spoke analysts mall owner ongoing redevelopments adding ca guarantee wo shakeout retail industry like store closures bankruptcies year later month mall owners come together las vegas international council shopping centers annual retail real estate conference largest gathering industry world discuss companies combating store closures working upstart digital brands open stores

Here's what went down: Last week the company reported select numbers — including a $700 million loss and deliveries that fell 31% from the previous quarter — while CEO Elon Musk swatted away questions about demand and refused to lower his expectations for the year to come. Then on Monday, Tesla released all of its numbers, and there were a few nasty surprises that it had neglected to mention the week before. For one thing, the company made $216 million selling auto-energy credits, without which it would have experienced a quarterly loss of about $900 million. For another, it stealthily changed its next ""milestone."" In its annual report, Tesla wrote it would make 500,000 Model 3s from June 30, 2019, through June 30, 2020. Now the electric-car maker says it's going to make 500,000 cars total during that period. It also admitted to having a problem with one of its suppliers that held up production in the first quarter. And finally, Tesla said it was in ""material compliance with all financial debt covenants"" by the end of the quarter. That may sound good, but this is Wall Street and words are tricky. Adding ""material"" to that sentence (as opposed to flat-out saying it is ""in compliance with all financial debt covenants"") means something is amiss. Tesla has yet to answer Business Insider's question about what exactly went wrong there. Tesla listed a litany of problems with the quarter, none of them having to do with the problem Wall Street is focused on — demand. Over and over again on the earnings call, as he's been doing for a few quarters now, Musk stressed that the company has no problem with demand. Musk and his colleagues made its dismal sales numbers and multiple price cuts over the quarter sound like a blip — one caused by seasonality, global logistical problems, an isolated supplier limitation, and difficulties manufacturing for more than one region and for different variants of a car at the same time. Tesla maintained that next quarter it's going to blow it out of the park and deliver 90,000 to 100,000 cars (compared with the 63,000 it delivered this quarter). So some bulls, like Jed Dorsheimer at Canaccord Genuity, say that should ""quell demand fears."" Bears, of course, don't buy Tesla's reasons for its sales collapse in the first quarter. They point to the fact that Tesla didn't make the mark this quarter and that it has a history of missing guidance. Musk dodged any questions about demand or future price cuts on the conference call. He played down the existence of the $35,000 Model 3 that the company had proposed with such fanfare. Now customers have to call Tesla if they want one, and Musk said on the conference call that Tesla is seeing evidence that customers who would've bought the $35,000 car are actually opting for the more expensive model. That should help with the car's margins, which fell from 25% in the fourth quarter to 20% in the first quarter. Tesla said in its filing that it ""may choose to seek alternative financing sources"" for its operations. That makes sense. The company is now sitting on $2.2 billion of cash and has guided to spending about the same amount in capital expenditures for the year. It's bleeding money, and it wants to finance the build-out of its Shanghai facility and the production of its Model Y and Semi next year. Over at Morgan Stanley, Adam Jonas, a longtime booster of the company, admits the story has changed. He just cut his price target on the stock (from $240 to $230) for the fourth time this year: We have long believed that Tesla's share price movement is driven by 3 primary factors: (1) demand, (2) cash flow and (3) access to capital markets. A deceleration in the first driver has led to an outflow of the second, leading to a more dilutive outcome of the third. If we think back to late 2018, when the stock was trading above the $350 range, few investors questioned near-term demand for the product as the Model 3 was hitting the streets in exponentially higher volume. At the same time, Tesla posted very strong free cash flow generation in the back-half of 2018 … leading many to think the moment of ""self-funding"" had finally arrived at Tesla. People thought self-funding had come to Tesla, in part, because Musk said it had. He reversed course last week when he introduced Tesla's plan to put 1 million self-driving robo-taxis on the road by the end of this year. He said that thanks to a chip that Tesla had developed, it was now leaps and bounds ahead of its self-driving-tech competition at Uber, General Motors, and Google. This without using lidar, a technology that uses lasers to measure distance to a target. Tesla's competitors all use it, but Musk has bashed it as foolish, unnecessary, and too expensive. Instead of swinging back to profitability, Musk says Tesla will use all of its resources to ensure that this robo-taxi plan is executed as soon as possible. Drivers, he said, can clear up to $30,000 a year if they upload this new technology and join Tesla's robo-taxi fleet. It's unclear how Tesla will get regulatory approval for this business, or how it will insure all of these cars (which Musk said it would likely be liable for). Tesla didn't answer any of our questions on that either. What we do know, though, is that the cost to build a robo-taxi is about $38,000. About the same amount it costs to build a Model 3, incidentally. We also know that Tesla held a big event to announce this change — likely because it's a big strategic shift. The word ""autonomous"" was not mentioned once in its January annual report, but it appeared four times in its most recent filing.

The head of the electric car maker reached a deal with the SEC on Friday, agreeing to submit his public statements about the company's finances and other topics to vetting by its legal counsel. However, SEC commissioner Robert Jackson registered his dissent after the deal was approved by a federal judge earlier on Tuesday. ""Given Mr. Musk's conduct, I cannot support a settlement in which he does not admit what is crystal clear to anyone who has followed this bizarre series of events,"" Jackson said in a statement. ""Musk breached the agreement he made last year with the Commission — and with American investors,"" he added. U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan approved the deal worked out on Friday that settled the dispute in which the SEC had sought to find Musk in contempt of a securities fraud settlement last year. Earlier this month, Nathan had ordered the parties to work out an arrangement between themselves. The new deal lays out in more detail what types of statements by Musk must be reviewed by Tesla's legal counsel before publication, such as financial statements, previously unreported production or delivery numbers, and other topics. Regulators had claimed that a February tweet by Musk about Tesla's production numbers violated the earlier settlement, as it had not been vetted by the company's attorneys. Musk countered that the tweet was not material. The SEC sued Musk last year for making fraudulent statements after he tweeted on Aug. 7 that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The parties eventually settled, and the deal called for Tesla's lawyers to pre-approve written communications, including tweets with material information about the company.",judge approves agreement elon musk sec ceo twitter use,securities exchange commissioner tuesday criticized settlement regulator tesla ceo elon musk use twitter head electric car maker reached deal sec friday agreeing submit public statements company finances topics vetting legal counsel however sec commissioner robert jackson registered dissent deal approved federal judge earlier tuesday given musk conduct support settlement admit crystal clear anyone followed bizarre series events jackson said statement musk breached agreement made last year commission american investors added district judge alison nathan manhattan approved deal worked friday settled dispute sec sought find musk contempt securities fraud settlement last year earlier month nathan ordered parties work arrangement new deal lays detail types statements musk must reviewed tesla legal counsel publication financial statements previously unreported production delivery numbers topics regulators claimed february tweet musk tesla production numbers violated earlier settlement vetted company attorneys musk countered tweet material sec sued musk last year making fraudulent statements tweeted funding secured take tesla private per share parties eventually settled deal called tesla lawyers written communications including tweets material information company

He can't, for instance, randomly tweet about Tesla's financial condition, proposed mergers and acquisitions, as well as previously unrevealed forecast, production and delivery numbers. The SEC took Musk to court in February over his tweet that says Tesla will produce 500,000 vehicles in 2019 -- a figure the agency said it hadn't previously disclosed. While the CEO followed that up by saying that the company is still expecting to deliver 400,000 vehicles, which falls in line with a previous projection, the SEC still sought to hold him in contempt of their previous agreement. See, it wasn't Musk's first clash with the agency: last year, he faced a securities fraud charge over tweets about taking Tesla private. As part of his settlement with the SEC, he had to step down as the automaker's chairman and to agree to have his social network posts containing material information reviewed by the company's legal team. The executive interpreted that agreement loosely, however, and argued that he had the right to decide whether a post needs pre-approval. And, yes, he didn't get his tweet containing the 500,000 production rate reviewed by Tesla's lawyers. As specified under the new agreement, though, he'll no longer be able to tweet production and delivery rates without the knowledge of the company's legal team. A previous Reuters report also said that if a judge approves the new agreement, SEC will drop its contempt charges against Musk, so he might not be facing any more possible repercussions for his tweet.",sec elon musk tweet agreement gets judge seal approval,elon musk knows exactly tesla information tweet without getting trouble securities exchange commission according wall street journal us district judge alison nathan signed agreement executive commission hammered days ago judge ordered settle dispute court agreement specifies musk ca publish platform without automaker lawyers ca instance randomly tweet tesla financial condition proposed mergers acquisitions well previously unrevealed forecast production delivery numbers sec took musk court february tweet says tesla produce vehicles figure agency said previously disclosed ceo followed saying company still expecting deliver vehicles falls line previous projection sec still sought hold contempt previous agreement see musk first clash agency last year faced securities fraud charge tweets taking tesla private part settlement sec step automaker chairman agree social network posts containing material information reviewed company legal team executive interpreted agreement loosely however argued right decide whether post needs yes get tweet containing production rate reviewed tesla lawyers specified new agreement though longer able tweet production delivery rates without knowledge company legal team previous reuters report also said judge approves new agreement sec drop contempt charges musk might facing possible repercussions tweet

Now ABC 7 News and NBC Bay Area report that Huang's family has filed a lawsuit against Tesla and the state of California. According to ABC reporter Dan Noyes, the lawsuit claims Huang's Model X was ""defective"" in its design, and blames the state for not making safety repairs on a safety barrier within the required amount of time. BREAKING NEWS: Tesla hit with lawsuit by family of Walter Huang, Apple Engineer who died last year when autopilot in Model X steered him into a traffic barrier Southbound 101 in Mountain View. #ABC7now pic.twitter.com/1cEql1vllc At the time, Tesla CEO Elon Musk published a blog post about the crash and revealed that ""The driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver's hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision."" He also claimed Autopilot ""unequivocally makes the world safer for the vehicle occupants, pedestrians and cyclists,"" and said the company was working with investigators to understand what happened. Huang's family members tell reporters that he'd mention how his vehicle would swerve toward the barrier while on Autopilot, and last year his brother said Huang complained to the Tesla dealership about it. When the Model X hit the barrier, the crash was particularly severe because a ""crash attenuator"" that would normally be there to reduce the force of the impact was missing due to a prior accident. All of this information has been noted in a preliminary report by the NTSB about the crash, however it hasn't been updated since last year. The report also notes that the car accelerated in the seconds prior to the crash, hitting the unprotected barrier at 70 MPH, breaching its battery and catching on fire. Since the crash, Tesla updated its software reminding drivers to touch the wheel more often and, ideally, remain attentive even with Autopilot enabled. It has continued to develop the Autopilot tech and promise a Full Self-Driving package, that works using radar and cameras without adding object-detecting LiDAR technology that Musk called ""expensive and unnecessary."" According to the CEO, Full Self-Driving will be available this year from Tesla with self-driving taxis by 2020 and, eventually, cars without a steering wheel or pedal.",tesla sued fatal model x crash autopilot engaged,last spring apple engineer walter huang aka wei lun huang died crash tesla model x hit median highway mountain view car autopilot driving assist engaged abc news nbc bay area report huang family filed lawsuit tesla state california according abc reporter dan noyes lawsuit claims huang model x defective design blames state making safety repairs safety barrier within required amount time breaking news tesla hit lawsuit family walter huang apple engineer died last year autopilot model x steered traffic barrier southbound mountain view time tesla ceo elon musk published blog post crash revealed driver received several visual one audible warning earlier drive driver hands detected wheel six seconds prior collision also claimed autopilot unequivocally makes world safer vehicle occupants pedestrians cyclists said company working investigators understand happened huang family members tell reporters mention vehicle would swerve toward barrier autopilot last year brother said huang complained tesla dealership model x hit barrier crash particularly severe crash attenuator would normally reduce force impact missing due prior accident information noted preliminary report ntsb crash however updated since last year report also notes car accelerated seconds prior crash hitting unprotected barrier mph breaching battery catching fire since crash tesla updated software reminding drivers touch wheel often ideally remain attentive even autopilot enabled continued develop autopilot tech promise full package works using radar cameras without adding lidar technology musk called expensive unnecessary according ceo full available year tesla taxis eventually cars without steering wheel pedal

ABC7's Dan Noyes obtained a copy of the lawsuit, which alleges that the car was ""defective in its design.""

Tesla published a blog post shortly after the crash, saying that Huang had ""received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive.""

Here's why it may not last,"Sainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe needed to pull a rabbit out of his hat after his attempt to merge the grocer with Asda was blown up by the Competition & Markets Authority. With his full year numbers, he found one. It’s just that a fluffy bunny is not the sort of thing that can be relied upon to keep the wolves from the door for long. The numbers Coupe unveiled contained much of what the City, which doesn’t tend to look much further than the end of its own nose, tends to coo over. Underlying profits - which strip out all sorts of nasties such as the £48m blown on the failed Asda experiment - were up 7.8 per cent at £692m and so (crucially) was the dividend. Debt was down, ditto underlying costs. It was better than analysts had expected and lit a fire under the shares, which were the biggest gainers on the FTSE 100 early on. But all those apparently fresh looking numbers need a little context. Let’s start with the shares. They’ve been bouncing around at near 30 year lows. Set against that, a 4 per cent boost to the price is like scoring a consolation goal in injury time to ease the pain of being down by five. Then there’s the “underlying” number Sainsbury’s was so keen for people to focus their attention on. It excluded fully £396m worth of supposedly “one off” items. In addition to the money the company blew on the deal, Sainsbury’s listed costs relating to guaranteed minimum pensions, retail restructuring, “Sainsbury’s Bank transition”, and the integration of Argos into the business. After factoring them all in, profits slumped by 41.6 per cent to just £239m. That’s a lot less fluffy than the underlying number Coupe was so keen to show off. It has risen for two years in a row but pre tax profits have been down for three. Given how regularly these “one offs” are hitting Sainsbury’s, how much meaning does that underlying number really have? One that does have meaning is like for like sales, which looks at stores open at least a year to gauge how well they’re doing, while stripping out fuel, the price of which is very volatile and so has a tendency to distort the figures.",sainsbury results buy ceo coupe breathing space asda deal failure may last,sainsbury boss mike coupe needed pull rabbit hat attempt merge grocer asda blown competition markets authority full year numbers found one fluffy bunny sort thing relied upon keep wolves door long numbers coupe unveiled contained much city tend look much end nose tends coo underlying profits strip sorts nasties blown failed asda experiment per cent crucially dividend debt ditto underlying costs better analysts expected lit fire shares biggest gainers ftse early apparently fresh looking numbers need little context let start shares bouncing around near year lows set per cent boost price like scoring consolation goal injury time ease pain five underlying number sainsbury keen people focus attention excluded fully worth supposedly one items addition money company blew deal sainsbury listed costs relating guaranteed minimum pensions retail restructuring sainsbury bank transition integration argos business factoring profits slumped per cent lot less fluffy underlying number coupe keen show risen two years row pre tax profits three given regularly one offs hitting sainsbury much meaning underlying number really one meaning like like sales looks stores open least year gauge well stripping fuel price volatile tendency distort figures

The rebates, announced in the last Liberal budget, will take up to $5,000 off the cost of electric vehicles, and $2,500 off plug-in hybrids, but they initially applied only to cars that cost less than $45,000. Ottawa is raising that to $55,000 to increase the options a buyer can choose and still receive the rebate, which will allow some of the most popular cars, including the Tesla Model 3, to qualify. Tesla recently launched a cheaper Model 3 in Canada with a 150-kilometre-range to qualify for the previous limit, according to Electrek. Nine electric cars and 13 plug-in hybrids are eligible, including the country's second- and third-most popular electric cars, the Nissan Leaf and the Chevrolet Bolt. Electric car experts say there is no doubt government incentives help drive electric-car purchases, noting when the new conservative government in Ontario killed a $14,000 rebate last year, electric-car sales in that province plummeted. Road transportation accounts for as much as one-fifth of Canada's emissions and the incentives are part of the federal government's strategy to meet its international targets for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to halt climate change.",federal rebates electric cars kick tesla model qualify,federal rebates encourage canadians buy electric cars take effect today rebates announced last liberal budget take cost electric vehicles hybrids initially applied cars cost less ottawa raising increase options buyer choose still receive rebate allow popular cars including tesla model qualify tesla recently launched cheaper model canada qualify previous limit according electrek nine electric cars hybrids eligible including country popular electric cars nissan leaf chevrolet bolt electric car experts say doubt government incentives help drive purchases noting new conservative government ontario killed rebate last year sales province plummeted road transportation accounts much canada emissions incentives part federal government strategy meet international targets reducing emissions halt climate change

It's called Wav, pronounced wave, and it's a battery-powered jet ski-style watercraft that the company wants to take out of the concept stage and into a lake. The boat, which looks like it stepped off the set of a Transformers movie, was inspired by the design of sport bikes with ""wakeboard"" architecture, according to the company. Few specifications have been released by the Arizona-based car company apart from a few teaser images and a short video. Pricing has yet to be announced, but potential buyers can reserve a Wav of their own via the source link on the company's website. So far, we do know that features include a console-mounted 4K touchscreen display and LED head- and tail lights. There's also a storage area that stretches from bow to stern. The electric motor produces instant torque, and all of the electronics are protected by a waterproofing system. “With WAV, you can feel the rush of power and acceleration in your chest, with the sound of the water and breeze in your ears,” said Jordan Darling, vice president of Nikola Powersports in a press release. What's a frunk?  Electric cars like Rivian, Tesla, Jaguar offer unique storage spaces Are there cameras in my car?: Possibly. The company says WAV is an acronym for Water Adventure Vehicle. The powertrain comes with waterproof rating that allows it to be submerged in more than 4 feet of water for up to thirty minutes.   The electric jet ski debuted recently in Arizona along with four other Nikola vehicles that the company claims are zero emission products. Nikola showed a new hydrogen fuel cell truck for the European market, a truck for long-range driving, an autonomous-capable military all-terrain vehicle, and an off-highway vehicle.

Elon Musk previously teased a May launch date for the most ""affordable"" car in Tesla's range, after a rocky start to deliveries in Europe. At this point, some customers have had their Model 3 reserved for three years, with demand remaining strong throughout that time. Since its announcement, the saloon car's offering has changed several times, most significantly removing the very lowest models that the new EV's promised affordability were based on. As it stands, prices for the Model 3 start at £38,900 ($50,853) for the Standard Range Plus model, rising to £47,900 ($62,691) for the Long Range model and £56,900 ($74,385) for the top-end Performance model. US retail prices start at $39,500, $49,500 and $59,500 for the above models, respectively, but don't include taxes. The company's payment summary on the Tesla e-commerce site itemises the cost, listing the VAT, 'destination and documentation fee' and the UK's £3,500 Plug-In Car Grant, all of which are included. However, the site then highlights £9,500 of fuel savings ($12,419, but Tesla sets that at $4,300 in the US) compared to a petrol vehicle, and comes up with an 'after savings' price of £29,400 ($38,434). This is likely a move to justify the car's cost and give a figure that can be more easily compared with the purchase price of petrol vehicles, but it's not the clearest way to get that across.  The cost of charging the Model 3 also does not appear to be factored into this calculation, which is particularly confusing since Tesla's Superchargers won't be free to use for Model 3 owners. Model X and Model S owners get free lifetime use of the Supercharger network. Elon Musk has commented that free Supercharging would be too expensive for the company to provide to owners of the lower-cost vehicle – financial security is a particularly acute concern after Tesla laid off 7 percent of its workforce in January. Adding Tesla's 'Full Self-Driving Capability' to the Model 3 increases the cost by £4,900 ($6,405) if you order it before delivery, or £6,800 ($8,889) if it's added after. Those options are priced at $5,000 and $7,000, respectively, in the US.

Not a facsimile of Reedus, or an approximation — it's a near-perfect re-creation of Reedus, tattoos and all. Screenshot/YouTube Though plenty of games feature motion capture technology, Reedus was captured by Kojima and his team at Kojima Productions using some very intense setups. One example of such a setup was revealed during a panel Business Insider attended featuring Kojima and Reedus at the Tribeca Film Festival last week in New York City. Behold: Whoa.
Ben Gilbert/Business Insider That is a lot of cameras! ""We were scanning his body, hands, tattoos, face. Just doing that took two days,"" Kojima said at the panel through a translator. Reedus also did more standard motion capture for the game — wearing a leotard covered in tiny balls that are tracked by cameras, thus allowing a computer to map his movement to an in-game avatar — but the most fascinating stuff he did for the game is a greater detail of depth than just motion capture. Ben Gilbert/Business Insider Unfortunately for us, there's no way to play as Norman Reedus in ""Death Stranding"" just yet, as the game isn't available — it's still in production and has no release date just yet. It's also not clear exactly what type of game it will be when it does arrive. Kojima described it as an open-world action game, and offered few details beyond that. What we know for sure is that it's an extremely pretty game: YouTube/PlayStation When ""Death Stranding"" does arrive, it'll head exclusively to Sony's PlayStation (it's expected to be available on both the PlayStation 4 and Sony's next-generation PlayStation console).

Specifically, nobody who follows the company seems even remotely interested in figuring out which industry the carmaker is actually in. The problem predictably resurfaced this week when, in its 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) following underwhelming first-quarter earnings, Tesla reported that in addition to a relatively modest $15 million in zero-emission-credit (ZEV) sales, the company also sold about $200 million in non-ZEV credits. ""Tesla Analyst Miffed by Credit Sales Missing From Musk's Call,"" read the Bloomberg headline atop a story that pointed out how Tesla had failed to note the non-ZEV credits, which might have originated through a deal with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to mitigate the latter's emissions penalties in Europe, according to Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein. It's fair to point out that Tesla and CEO Elon Musk didn't say anything about the additional credits when the company reported earnings. The sale did knock a nearly $1 billion loss down to a mere $700 million. It's unfair to attribute some nefarious motive to the sale, however. Read more: Tesla is getting slammed for doing something that it would be stupid to avoid As I've argued before, Tesla can sell emission credits, ZEV or non-ZEV, whenever it wants. In fact, Musk has rightly maintained that Tesla gets a raw deal on credit sales because it can't always move them for their full price: The existing credit regime in California, for example, discounts ZEV credits for Tesla because of buyers being able to control their own demand. The Tesla Model Y.
Tesla That aside, emission credits are baked into Tesla's business. It's the only automaker on the planet that produces electric vehicles and nothing else, so it consequently racks up a huge number of credits. Naysayers label this a subsidy, but of course it pales in comparison to the titanic handout traditional car companies get from the US government, which hasn't raised the gas tax since the 1990s. There's no good reason for Tesla to hoard credits, but every time it sells any or does a deal along the lines of the one it reportedly struck with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, it gets clobbered. Simply for doing business as an all-electric automaker. Musk has been playing nice with Wall Street since last year's infamous flip-out, but the reality is that Tesla doesn't much care for the public markets (Musk's failed take-private scheme from 2018 wasn't exactly surprising — he'd been grousing about excessive Wall Street scrutiny for some time). Musk's dislike for banks is intensified by his robust appetite for capital. He'll probably have to go hat in hand to the financiers again this year to raise money, either through issuing equity or through another round of junk-bond issuance. Wall Street, for its part, is going through another one of its troubling epiphanies about Tesla's business, which it does what it can to ignore. Disregard the silliness pumped out by Ark Invest (Tesla goes to $4,000 a share!) and focus on the investment banks. Sell-side analysts certainly grasp that even as Tesla grows its market, the case for a $40 billion market capitalization is very, very weak. Their business is electric cars.
Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider As the fundamental grind of building and selling vehicles has become Tesla's daily struggle — its poor first-quarter results were largely because of logistics challenges in shipping cars to Europe and Asia — Wall Street has pulled back on ambitious price targets and soured on Tesla's disruptive capabilities. Some of these analysts are auto experts, and they know where the story leads: General Motors and Ford have posted so many profitable quarters since the financial crisis that the margins have gotten routine, and yet share prices go nowhere. That's probably Tesla's destiny: to be a middle-of-the-pack, but still quite successful, purveyor of electric transportation. Over time, emission-credit revenue could become for Tesla what captive auto lending is for a major automaker: a sustainably lucrative cash generator. And that's why Wall Street (and everybody else) should get over Tesla's tactics when it comes to selling emission credits. It's revenue, for crying out loud! Tesla needs the cash.

While Tesla's electric vehicles are gaining popularity, its solar business has been in retreat in an ultra-competitive market. Tesla lost its crown as America's leading rooftop solar installer in 2018, falling behind lesser-known rival Sunrun (RUN), according to research firm Wood Mackenzie. Now Musk is trying to jump-start Tesla's solar business with a simple strategy: Cutting costs. Sharply. Tesla has cut its solar panel prices below the national average. ""Tesla is likely hoping to use low prices to drive out competition and gain market share,"" said Timothy Fox, vice president and research analyst at Clearview Energy Partners, an energy research firm. To make the cost cuts work, Tesla has standardized systems and begun to require customers to order solar panels online, the company told The New York Times this week. By stopping door-to-door sales, Tesla is trying to slash so-called ""soft"" costs that play a significant role driving up the price tag on solar panels. A Tesla spokesperson confirmed the changes reported by the Times. The new prices have been posted on Tesla's website. Tesla announced last fall that price cuts were coming. Tesla's 'half-court shot'? But some observers on Wall Street are skeptical that Tesla can pull off the strategy without eating into its already-shrinking bottom line. Profit margins in the solar industry are razor-thin. ""It feels like a half-court shot,"" said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who recently downgraded his rating on Tesla. SolarCity was the No. 1 solar player when Tesla made a controversial $2.6 billion deal in 2016 to acquire the company, which was founded and run by two of Musk's cousins. While Musk pitched the acquisition as a way for Tesla to become a one-stop shop for clean energy, analysts say the benefits have been elusive. ""So far, it's been like a first-round draft pick that was a bust,"" said Ives. Tesla falls behind Sunrun Understandably, Tesla's main priority is its far larger electric vehicle business. The company has spent heavily on mass-producing the Model 3, developing self-driving technology and building massive factories to manufacture batteries. Tesla's solar business, on the other hand, has shrunk by about 60%, according to Colin Rusch, senior research analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. ""They've really throttled that business back and stopped throwing cash at it like SolarCity was,"" said Ben Kallo, an analyst at Baird. That has allowed Tesla's solar rivals to catch up. In 2018, Tesla dropped to second place in the solar home installation race in 2018 behind Sunrun and just ahead of Vivint Sola (VSLR)r, according to consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. ""Elon Musk has a lot of priorities on his desk,"" said Fox. ""His competitors may just have a more singular focus that has allowed them to gain market share."" In a statement, Sunrun said it ""welcomes"" industry efforts to reduce costs and is ""actively engaged"" in cutting soft costs through permitting reform and other activities. Cutting prices Tesla's solar business isn't big enough to really move the needle on Wall Street. Shareholders care way more about the latest Model 3 numbers. ""Most investors assign minimal value to it,"" said Ives. ""It continues to be more of a distraction than a value-creator."" But Tesla is trying to change that by slashing costs. Depending upon where they live, Tesla customers can now expect to pay $1.75 to $1.99 per watt after a federal tax incentive. After accounting for the federal investment tax credit, the national average is $2.14 per watt, according to EnergySage, an online marketplace for buying and selling solar that is backed by the Energy Department. Tesla's price cuts are overdue, Rusch said. ""They were going after aggressive pricing that was unnecessarily high,"" he said. Tesla has a big advantage over its competitors: brand recognition. ""They retain the sexy factor. It's a company with a household name and a well-known CEO,"" said Fox. When will the Gigafactory 2 ramp up? Most of Tesla's solar panels are manufactured by third-parties based in China, Japan and Korea, according to analysts. However, Tesla is hoping to make its solar business more viable by mass-producing panels at a factory in Buffalo, New York. The facility, known as Gigafactory 2, is owned by the state and run by Panasonic (PCRFF). Production began at the Buffalo factory in early 2018, though construction has not yet been completed, Tesla said in a filing on Monday. Tesla said it plans to meet certain hiring and investment requirements at Gigafactory 2, but warned that it could need to pay New York ""significant amounts"" if it fails to do so. Bigger picture, Tesla's price cuts underscore the advances made in the solar industry. Plunging costs have allowed both wind and solar to steal market share from coal. For the first time ever, America's renewable energy sector may have generated more electricity than coal during the month of April, according to a recent report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Sign up here and it will be delivered directly to your inbox Monday to Friday. TODAY: Life's a riot in Paris The protesters had vowed to transform the City of Lights into the ""capital of rioting."" And violence did flare at today's massive May Day march in Paris, with police making liberal use of tear gas and rubber-pellet-spreading ""sting"" grenades in an effort to quell the minority of troublemakers who threw stones, overturned cars and erected flaming barricades in the streets. By early evening local time, authorities had made more than 250 arrests, and carried out almost 13,000 ""preventive searches"" of people and cars. Spooked by six-straight months of sometimes-violent ""yellow vest"" protests across France, and desperate to avoid a repeat of the looting and fires that blighted Paris a year ago, the government had dispatched 7,400 riot police to the capital. Shops and restaurants along the planned route were advised to lock their doors and board up windows, and 30 metro stations were preventatively shut.  Squads of motorcycle cops stood at the ready to rush to trouble spots, while drones patrolled the skies — all part of what President Emmanuel Macron called his ""extremely firm"" approach to his critics. The show of strength comes on the heels of a recently enacted law that gives police the right to stop people and examine their bags and vehicles, and makes it a criminal offence for protestors to conceal their faces — punishable by up to a year in jail and a $23,000 Cdn fine. But that didn't stop hundreds of masked youths from spilling into Paris streets today, or dampen the spirits of a crowd that some estimated to be as large as 55,000 people. It wasn't just the populist ""yellow vests"" either, but also ""black block"" anarchists, members of the far-right National Front, trade unionists, feminist activists and anti-climate change marchers — part of a widening anti-Macron coalition that marked the traditional May celebration of labour with some 230 protests across France. The marches come six days after the French president unveiled his latest response to the protests that have now dogged his government for 24 consecutive weeks. In a nationally televised speech last Thursday, Macron told his audience that the yellow vest movement, which began last November as a reaction to a new fuel tax and service cuts, had made some ""just demands"" and tapped into legitimate feelings of ""anger and impatience for change."" And he promised income tax cuts, a return to pension indexing, greater proportional representation and more referendums in response — measures that will cost an estimated 7 billion Euros ($10.5 billion Cdn) in addition to the 10 billion Euros ($15 billion Cdn) in reforms he announced last December. The yellow vest leaders panned Macron's plan as ""too little, too late,"" and returned to the streets last Saturday, and again today. The number of demonstrators is falling — 23,000 across the country and just 2,600 in Paris last weekend, according to the government. But the big question for Macron remains what will bottom out first, the angry crowds in the streets or his popularity? Opinion surveys suggest that 41-year-old reformer now has about 30 per cent support, half of what he enjoyed when he came to power in 2017. The next elections aren't until 2022, but Macron already faces an uphill battle. The last president of France to win re-election was Jacques Chirac — back in 2002. More green for going green A new federal rebate is raising interest in electric vehicles, but it's not enough to get everyone into the EV driver's seat just yet, reporter David Common writes. As of today, the federal government will give buyers and leasers of new electric vehicles up to $5,000. Add that to provincial rebates, and some drivers could cut the cost of a vehicle by more than $10,000. So why isn't everyone rushing out to take the free money? A trip to Rossland, B.C., helped us understand. The community of about 4,000 is isolated, surrounded by snowy mountains where winter temperatures can reduce the range of electric vehicles. It's seven hours by road from both Vancouver and Calgary. As it is for many Canadians, having enough juice for road trips is a key EV selling point for people in Rossland. ""My requirements were a 500 km range and all-wheel drive for the mountains,"" Mike Greene explained. And that left him with only one choice of vehicle, so he swapped out his 1997 Honda Civic for a Tesla Model 3. Quite the upgrade — a quick check of Tesla's website this morning shows the long-range all-wheel-drive model priced at $68,510. ""I've had it for six months, with no regrets,"" Greene added. There are five Tesla owners in the small town. And they aren't the only residents driving zero-emission vehicles. But the limited selection was a consistent theme at the EV showcase in a parking lot off the historic centre of Rossland on a recent weekend. There are just 28 EV models on sale in Canada now that the federal rebate will cover. Most of them are small vehicles. Only a handful have an electric range of more than 350 km. Combine that with price points typically over $35,000 and many consumers are steering clear of the greener choice, even when fuel savings of about $2,000 a year a factored in. But at Rossland's rural EV showcase, dozens did show up looking for a test drive. ""That's the big barrier, not seeing them in person,"" organizer Jen Grebeldinger told us. ""So that's why we do these events, getting people in the seat so they realize 'oh it's just a car.'"" And the questions poured out: As the event ended in Rossland, more than a few were convinced. Their next car would be an EV. Others liked the idea. They're just waiting for lower prices, better ranges, and bigger vehicle offerings. The good news is that all those things appear to be in the pipeline. - David Common Coping with allergies that can kill The National's Health Panel tonight focuses on the dos and dont's of dealing with food-related allergies — and shares some potentially life saving wisdom, producer Ghazala Malik writes. It seems the list of allergy-inducing foods just keeps getting longer. A recent Canadian case study, for example, explores how foods containing pea protein are responsible for an increase in allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. ""One of the hardest things is the quality of life aspect when it comes to dealing with allergies. Especially with kids,"" Dr. Zainab Abdurrahman says. The pediatric allergist and professor at McMaster University says she sees a lot of anxiety in her clients with food allergies, as well as in parents of children with allergies. For parents, the balancing act between trying to ensure their kids have a regular childhood while also being vigilant can lead to a lot of stress, and in many cases even feelings of guilt. Her advice to parents: ""Be practical. Your child has to interact with the outside world. So we have to be able to make this work. Parents want to protect their kids, and the best way to do that is by educating yourselves and them."" But one of the biggest misconceptions around food-related allergies is that it's an issue limited to childhood or early adulthood. According to Dr. Samir Sinha, a geriatrician at Mount Sinai Hospital, this is a dangerous mindset that needs to change. ""One of the challenges we see is that with adults, late-onset allergies actually go misdiagnosed and under-recognized. A person might be going to a primary care physician or specialist and saying, 'I have been having these symptoms,' and it might not even occur to the provider that these are allergies,"" since the patient is older, says Sinha. Whether it's a childhood food-related allergy or one that crops up later in life, all three panelists stress the importance of always carrying an EpiPen, a portable self-injector that administers medication to treat severe allergic reactions. Dr. Lennox Huang, who works in pediatric critical care at Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, recommends carrying more than one EpiPen, because in some cases a double dose may be required to counteract an extreme anaphylactic reaction. ""Practice again and again how to administer the EpiPen. If the need arises, you shouldn't stop to think. You should just do it. It will save your life or the life of a loved one.""

Quote of the moment ""For a decade the IAAF has tried to slow me down, but this has actually made me stronger … I will once again rise above and continue to inspire young women and athletes in South Africa and around the world."" - Caster Semenya, two-time Olympic gold medalist in the women's 800 metre, reacts to a Court of Arbitration for Sport decision upholding track and field rules that will require her to medically reduce her naturally high testosterone levels. What The National is reading Today in history May 1, 1989: May Day in the era of perestroika As Mikhail Gobrachev took his place atop Lenin's tomb in Red Square to watch the May Day celebrations, his political grip seemed firmer than ever. Just days before, he had forced 110 old-guard members of the Soviet parliament to retire. But as Don Murray shows there is bubbling public discontent over short supplies and long lines for such basic goods as soap, razorblades, shoes and shirts. The return of sugar rationing after 40 years is the newest wrinkle — ""too many people were hoarding it to make moonshine,"" explains one Moscovite.

An Orange County money manager is advising his high net worth clients about pushing more money into alternative investments to weather a downturn. An investment manager at a sovereign wealth fund is looking to sell whatever he can. The three execs, who spoke on the sidelines of this week's Milken Institute Global Conference and asked for anonymity to discuss their situations, captured one of the moods at this year's conference: successful, but bracing for the worst. Even with stock markets at record highs and US economic growth for the first quarter that blew past most expectations, the conference-goers assembled in Beverly Hills privately fretted that the good times may soon end. This was the 22nd global conference hosted by junk bond king Michael Milken, who brings together the Masters of the Universe of the finance and investing worlds for an annual celebration of capitalism, and panels on changing the world. Read more: IMF chief Christine Lagarde outlines her 2 major worries around the global economy — and explains why they're sowing the seeds of a new crisis Over the course of three days, one topic of conversation that frequently arose among a subset of attendees: the tepid M&A market and what it means for the broader economy. The lack of deal activity — while credited by some for making this year's conference so well attended with over 4,000 — may be a harbinger of trouble ahead, according to Jason Greenberg, head of tech M&A at Jefferies. In his view, corporate c-suites and boardrooms tend to look at the next six months and use that to develop sentiment around M&A. If they're not doing deals it means that something they see has them worried, he said. ""I tend to think of M&A as the canary in the coal mine,"" Greenberg said on a Tuesday afternoon panel. ""By the middle to the end of this year, it's either going to do what it did in 2015 — which was that businesses started to feel better again and things started taking off — or it'll end up being a precursor to a recession."" Layer on top concerns about the rising populism and calls from people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for higher taxes on the wealthy, or New York City's recently proposed pied-a-terre tax, and the attendees at this year's conference were at times uneasy and at times searching for answers. ""What's really coming is class warfare,"" said Alan Schwartz, a managing partner at Guggenheim Partners, in another panel discussion. ""Throughout the centuries, when the masses think the elites have too much, one of the two things happens: legislation to redistribute the wealth, or revolution to distribute poverty."" Read more: The CEO of SoftBank Investment Advisers, who runs the world's biggest venture fund, offers an inside look at how he picks which companies to lavish with billions of capital Despite those worries and the panel discussions, the conference remains an unabashed celebration of the world's wealthy. Expensive luxury cars made by companies like Maserati, Porsche and Tesla routinely circled the Beverly Hilton's driveway, the roar of powerful engines echoing off the hotel's portico. Off the lobby, Bombardier set up a booth to display its new Global 7500 private jet. State Street's Fearless Girl statute stood in the same spot last year. Blackstone's Steven Schwarzman came in on Sunday wearing a baseball cap pulled low over his eyes. Apollo's Leon Black made an appearance, as did real estate titan Thomas Barrack, seen Monday outside of the Peninsula hotel, one of several nearby hotels that served as satellite meeting spaces. On Monday, Wells Fargo executives John Shrewsberry and Mary Mack held court in the center of the Waldorf Astoria's lobby. Billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio was seen holding down a corner table Tuesday afternoon at Circa 55. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon was seen on Wilshire Blvd at one point, leaning against a building on a phone call, reading from a piece of paper. Tim O'Hara, the former CEO of Credit Suisse and now BlackRock exec walked through the crowd, saying hi to old colleagues. With thousands swarming the hotel, lines snaked around corners and space was at a premium. Longtime sponsors like State Street hosted clients from cabana rooms just off the pool, while others, like Dalio or the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, chose to reserve tables in the hotel's restaurants. Others like Barings and Canyon Partners settled for space upstairs in hotel suites converted into meeting spaces by removing the beds. Those without space tussled over seats in the lobby bar. And of course there were after parties. An official reception held Monday night at Ron Burkle's Soho House included appearances from former Detroit Pistons power forward John Salley and music from Limp Bizkit front man, Fred Durst. Even Milken made an appearance, mingling in a backroom where wicker lanterns hung from olive trees below a retractable roof.

U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan approved the deal worked out on Friday that settled the dispute in which the SEC had sought to find Musk in contempt of a securities fraud settlement last year. The deal says Musk must get a securities lawyer's approval before writing or talking on investor calls about a broad range of Tesla-related topics. The fracas stemmed from a tweet last year in which Musk said that he had 'funding secured' to take Tesla private at $420 a share, and a subsequent tweet about production numbers that the SEC said violated his settlement in that case. A federal judge on Tuesday approved a deal struck between Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk (above earlier this month) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Earlier this month, Nathan had ordered the parties to work out an arrangement between themselves. The new deal lays out in more detail what types of statements by Musk must be reviewed by Tesla's legal counsel before publication, such as financial statements, previously unreported production or delivery numbers, and other topics. Regulators had claimed that a February tweet by Musk about Tesla's production numbers violated the earlier settlement, as it had not been vetted by the company's attorneys. Musk countered that the tweet was not material. The SEC sued Musk last year for making fraudulent statements after he tweeted on August 7 that he had 'funding secured' to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The SEC sued Musk last year for making fraudulent statements following this tweet The parties eventually settled, and the deal called for Tesla's lawyers to pre-approve written communications, including tweets with material information about the company. The SEC said Musk violated the deal with a February 19 tweet about Tesla vehicle production that wasn't approved by the company's 'disclosure counsel.' The agency contended that Musk hadn't sought the lawyer's approval for a single tweet. Musk's attorneys contended his tweet that Tesla would produce about 500,000 vehicles this year didn't need approval because it wasn't new information that would be meaningful to investors. They said the SEC was violating Musk's First Amendment rights to free speech. The new agreement requires Musk to get approval in advance from 'an experienced securities lawyer' employed by Tesla, which is based in Palo Alto, California, before he issues any written communication on a wide range of financial topics.  These are the tweets the SEC says are in violation of Musk's agreement not to tweet about materials which could impact Tesla shareholders without permission. He says the tweets were innocent and no different to the projections Tesla had already announced SEC commissioner Robert Jackson registered his dissent after the deal was approved by a federal judge earlier on Tuesday.

So what went wrong?","Updated May 02, 2019 14:45:41 When Labor announced its plan to boost the number of electric cars in Australia over the next decade, an election campaign battleground opened up. Prime Minister Scott Morrison accused his rival of wanting to ""end the weekend when it comes to his policy on electric vehicles""; Bill Shorten returned fire by accusing the Government of running a ""scare campaign"". But electric cars aren't new — they've been around for more than a century. And for a moment at the advent of the automobile industry, they even threatened to become the dominant mode of transport. From the late 19th century, electric cars began to trickle onto the streets of major American cities, representing a formidable part of the automobile trade. A carriage could now be transported by electricity instead of horse — the culmination of centuries of technological innovation and invention.  The electric car soon became the favoured method of personal transportation, well and truly surpassing its underdeveloped, gas-guzzling counterpart. ""In 1901, 38 per cent of the cars were electric, and 20 per cent or so were petrol, and in the middle, there was the outgoing technology of steam,"" says technologist and historian David Kirsch. ""If you'd asked the great experts of their age in 1900 which technology would come to dominate the motor-based transportation, I think most learned people would have said electricity."" But history would prove them wrong. Advances in internal combustion engines in the first decade of the 20th century lessened the relative advantages of the electric car. ""The unexpected progress of internal combustion … surprised everybody by making extraordinary advances in that first decade,"" Professor Kirsch says. ""By 1910 you had the Model T, the iconic universal vehicle that was able to do almost everything that an electric vehicle could do and more."" The Electric Vehicle Company, doomed to become a victim of its own business malpractice, was partly responsible for the demise of the product it was named for. Founded in the final years of the 19th century, it rose to prominence with its Electrobats, considered the first truly useful electric car for day-to-day transportation.  The company pioneered a taxi system of leased vehicles that used service stations for quick battery changes and repair work. In 1899 a syndicate of prominent car manufacturers took over the rising company to form the Lead Cab Trust, which hoped to develop a monopoly across the US. It was the largest motor car manufacturer in the USA, but lost its position only two years later. It faced rising competition from petrol-powered cars, but also hefty legal cases targeting its monopolistic practices. The great hope of electric vehicles did not outlast the first decade of the 20th century. The oil crash of the 1970s renewed attempts to reinvigorate the electric car. But it wasn't until 2008 that the first viable option emerged, thanks to Elon Musk's Tesla Motors. Its Roadster was first the serial production, all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells. It could travel a game-changing 320 kilometres per charge.  In 2016 Norway made the decision to ban the sales of petrol and diesel powered vehicles by 2025. China, India, Germany, France, and Britain have since followed suit, with slightly less ambitious deadlines. Sensing the oncoming change in the market, manufacturers are readily moving towards an electric future. By 2017 Tesla's global sales passed 250,000 units, in a market that now includes the Nissan Leaf and the Chevy Bolt, amongst others. That same year, Volvo announced it would produce only electric and hybrid vehicles, making it the first major automaker to abandon cars powered solely by the internal combustion engine. ""The recent announcement from Volvo strikes me as an acknowledgement that electrification is becoming normalised, at least for Volvo,"" Professor Kirsch says.  Into the future, electric car manufacturers must work out how to survive in a global auto industry that ""has long struggled with over-capacity, and relatively low profit margins"". ""I couldn't put an exact dollar figure on it but I think it is now clear to all the major players in the global auto industry that electrification is coming,"" Professor Kirsch says. ""The question now is managing that transition in some way, figuring out how to survive, how to make money through the transition and to envision a future for each company."" Labor's target is for half of all new cars sold in Australia by 2030 to be electric. The Government has criticised Labor's ambitions, but Senate Estimates has heard the Coalition's own target is between 25 and 50 per cent. While announcing Labor's plan, Mr Shorten suggested that it might be time to see car manufacturing return to Australia. ""If electric vehicles are part of our future, we are going to provide cheap finance so I would like to see us making electric cars in Australia,"" he said. But Professor Kirsch believes that might be an over-zealous proposal. ""Australia has a long history of vehicle manufacture, which came to an end a couple of years ago, in part because of globalisation of the vehicle production process and massive oversupply,"" he says.  Instead, he suggests that Australia's real opportunity comes from its unique supply of lithium, the chemical used in the manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries. ""The lithium deposits speak to a unique opportunity for Australia because those are particularly valuable resources as we look out at the likely development of the global battery industry,"" Professor Kirsch says. ""I think that's a possibility looking forward, or I would say it's a better option than trying to resuscitate final assembly in Australia."" But as we move forward, Professor Kirsch says the ultimate warning from technological history is to be ready for anything. ""The horseless carriage was a crude approximation of what the modern automobile looks like,"" he says. ""It involved taking a 19th century carriage that had a horse and just removing the horse.  ""It was preposterous on its face but within a few years we had a whole new set of designs and products that we were using in a very different way. ""Technology surprises us, and we shouldn't be surprised but we always are, that we can't predict the future.""

Both the standard range and standard range plus cars are now listed on the government's eligible vehicles page.

Oculus's new VR headset could become the next best way to check out cars without going to a dealership or car lot — or in Tesla's case, without buying the car sight unseen. The Oculus Quest was officially announced this week at Facebook's F8 conference and when it arrives on May 21 for $399 most of the attention will be on how it performs for gaming apps. For the non-gamers out there, however, the headset can give you a glimpse at what thousands of cars look like. It's one of the many non-gaming uses for VR that's getting a boost with the new device. RelayCars has a vast library of car imagery that lets you take a look at each one from all angles and while sitting in the driver seat. With images of 13,000 vehicles and counting, you can take a peek at the Tesla Model 3, a Mini Cooper, or even a Prius. During a demo, COO Gina Callari compared the app to a ""virtual auto show"" where you can hop from car to car, getting a feel for the vehicle without driving it. The library is stocked with luxury vehicles, big trucks, and everyday options like a Honda Accord or Toyota Camry. It's available for free on Oculus Go, Samsung's Gear VR, HTC Vive, and other VR platforms (there's also a mobile and tablet app with 360-degree images available for perusing for the VR-disinclined among us), but with the new Quest, the viewing experience will greatly improve. Currently you can explore the front seat of a Tesla, or any of the available cars, from a fixed point of view in VR. You can look all over, but you can't see what the car is like from the back seat or from other positions. With the Quest the RelayCars VR app will give what's known as 6DOF, or six degrees of freedom, instead of the usual 3DOF: pitch, roll, and yaw. The additional three are forward/backward, left/right, and up/down. This means you can move around the space, kneel down, get closer to the steering wheel, check out a decal on the trunk — much like you'd do when walking around a real car. It gets you that much closer to a realistic experience. So instead of trudging to a litany of different dealerships when looking for a new car, you can browse through various options the same way you shop for everything else: online.",really feels like tesla new oculus quest vr headset,tesla test drives scaled back options check model model sedan limited enough may need turn virtual reality see car buy oculus new vr headset could become next best way check cars without going dealership car lot tesla case without buying car sight unseen oculus quest officially announced week facebook conference arrives may attention performs gaming apps however headset give glimpse thousands cars look like one many uses vr getting boost new device relaycars vast library car imagery lets take look one angles sitting driver seat images vehicles counting take peek tesla model mini cooper even prius demo coo gina callari compared app virtual auto show hop car car getting feel vehicle without driving library stocked luxury vehicles big trucks everyday options like honda accord toyota camry available free oculus go samsung gear vr htc vive vr platforms also mobile tablet app images available perusing among us new quest viewing experience greatly improve currently explore front seat tesla available cars fixed point view vr look ca see car like back seat positions quest relaycars vr app give known six degrees freedom instead usual pitch roll yaw additional three means move around space kneel get closer steering wheel check decal trunk much like walking around real car gets much closer realistic experience instead trudging litany different dealerships looking new car browse various options way shop everything else online

But despite generous financial support, many of the best ""Fortnite"" players are unhappy with the game. Influential streamers like Tyler ""Ninja"" Blevins and Turner ""Tfue"" Tenney have expressed frustration with ""Fortnite's"" recent updates. Ninja called on Epic Games to fix the game's competitive balance, while Tfue said he plans to quit the game after the Fortnite World Cup is over. With up to 100 players competing against each other in any given match, ""Fortnite: Battle Royale"" is often defined by chaos. Even so, the game's best players can still earn consistent results with a mix of experience, building strategy, and quick reactions. But Epic Games also updates ""Fortnite"" every week with balance changes, new weapons, and other changes, making it more and more difficult for the players to adapt. The pressure to stay on top has some players threatening to quit the game entirely. After launching in September 2017, ""Fortnite"" has grown into the most popular game in the world with more than 250 million registered players. While the game has been hosted at a variety of esports events, the rules of competitive ""Fortnite"" have been in a state of constant flux. Read more: The creator of 'Fortnite' has banned more than 1,000 accounts for cheating during the first round of its $30 million tournament On April 28, a pair of ""Fortnite"" players won a $6,000 prize at the Collegiate Starleague Finals, but after the tournament, they said that they plan to quit playing the game. During their post-win interview, University of Georgia students Jack Stuttard and Ibrahim Diaz said Epic's balance changes had influenced their decision to move on.  ""We don't really like the game that much anymore, not gonna lie, we'll see what happens,"" Stuttard said on stage in Atlantic City. ""Epic is really messing around with the way they're balancing everything."" Diaz added, ""We decided we don't want to play competitive Fortnite anymore, so we're going to move on to different games or just different stuff."" Competitive ""Fortnite"" players have been particularly vocal about the game's balance as the Fortnite World Cup gets underway. The event has a $40 million prize pool, and is awarding $1 million per week to players during the online qualifying rounds. Players have criticized Epic's willingness to make big updates to ""Fortnite"" right before high stakes competitions, while known issues and bugs go unchanged.  Atop the list of controversial ""Fortnite"" changes is a featured called siphon. Siphon lets players recover health, shields, and building materials when they successfully eliminate another player. An update released on February 19th made siphon a standard part of battle royale, rewarding skilled players for recording multiple kills and playing aggressively. However, a patch released on March 26th removed siphon from the standard battle royale mode and added it to a new game type called arena. Some top players felt forced to play the new mode if they wanted to play aggressively, since it's harder to survive without the health recovery from siphon. While popular streamers spent weeks asking Epic to bring back siphon, the company is standing by the change. Epic Games spent five weeks collecting data on how the siphon changes influenced the standard battle royale and found that siphon was discouraging the vast majority of people who already struggle to keep up with the best players. ""Players at large grew more frustrated with 'Fortnite' play, feeling they had less of a chance due to encounters with high-skill players with full health and shields,"" Epic said in a statement on competitive balance. ""Ultimately, Siphon increased engagement for the highest-skilled 10%, while the remaining 90% were more frustrated and played less.""

CEO Elon Musk had insisted through much of the last year that the company was doing fine and would not need to raise additional cash. But a depressed stock price forced it to pay off a $920 million bond in March with cash rather than stock. That payment was a big factor in the company's cash reserves falling by $1.5 billion during the quarter, leaving it with just over $2 billion in cash on its balance sheet. It also reported a $702 million loss in the quarter. After reporting results last week, Musk told investors that ""at this point, I do think there ... is some merit to raising capital."" The timing and the extent of that raise was not disclosed at that time. Tesla plans to sell about $650 million in stock and $1.35 billion in debt which could be converted to stock at some point in the future. The company's underwriters also have the option to purchase up to an additional 15% of each offering. Tesla intends to use proceeds from the offerings to strengthen its balance sheet, as well as for general corporate purposes. Musk himself intends to buy $10 million of the shares once they are offered. Tesla (TSLA) shares jumped 4% in premarket trading following the filings. Although the additional shares will dilute the value of current Tesla shares, investors had been prepared for the capital raise since last week. Some may have been preparing for an even larger sale of shares. There had also been concerns that the company could find itself in a cash crunch without a cash raise. ""We view this as a clear net positive for Tesla,"" said Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, in a note to clients Thursday. ""The company needed to take its medicine and clear the air of the very real investor worries that the company would not having enough capital to meet its debt obligation this November and future [capital spending] needs.""

A lot of it. After a surprisingly weak first quarter, in which it burned through nearly $1 billion, the company said Thursday that it would seek to raise about $2 billion in the markets. The electric-car maker plans to offer investors 2.72 million shares of stock, which would raise about $650 million, and $1.35 billion of debt securities that can convert to stock at a later date, according to a regulatory filing. The plan could raise as much as $2.3 billion if demand is great enough for the banks underwriting it to sell additional stock and bonds. Wall Street analysts, noting Tesla’s haphazard progress, had long expected the company to return to the public markets for fresh capital. “It was kind of inevitable,” said Vicki Bryan, chief executive of the research firm Bond Angle. “It was overdue.” It’s the first time in two years that Tesla has turned to the equity markets for capital and its biggest issue of new shares since it raised $2.3 billion in 2016. After the company’s initial public offering in 2010, Tesla had sold shares or convertible securities every year through 2017, raising roughly $8 billion, according to data from Dealogic. Selling new shares often depresses a company’s stock price, but Tesla’s stock ended the day up 4.3 percent, a sign that some investors still believe the company can achieve its ambitious goals, and are willing to finance those dreams. “This is pretty important for Tesla,” said Ross Gerber, the chief executive of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, who owns Tesla shares. “We’re very excited because they are able to raise the capital at a very low cost.” Tesla shares trade at a high valuation. As a result, the company is effectively paying little when it issues new shares. Tesla said its chief executive, Elon Musk, would spend $10 million buying new shares. Mr. Musk had said for months that Tesla did not need to raise new capital. Then, when discussing the company’s first-quarter results last week, he said there was “merit to the idea of raising capital at this point.” But it probably would have made more financial sense when Tesla’s stock price was a lot higher. With the stock down by more than a third from its 2018 peak, Tesla must sell more shares to raise the same amount of money. When new stock is sold, existing shareholders end up with a smaller stake in the company if they do not take part in the new offering. The plan to raise money also underscored Tesla’s reliance on the good graces of public-market investors. Mr. Musk indicated last year that he wanted to take Tesla private. Discussions with investors set off a series of events that led to Mr. Musk’s saying on Twitter he had secured funding to do just that. The Securities and Exchange Commission said his declaration was misleading, and Mr. Musk later reached a settlement with the regulator that forced him to step down as the company’s chairman. If Tesla raises $2 billion, it can use the money as a buffer in case its operations continue to stumble and consume large amounts of cash this year. In recent months, Tesla has not sold enough cars to cover its operating expenses. Sales of its main product, the Model 3 sedan, tumbled in the first quarter. As a result, the company’s operations used $640 million in cash in the period. In addition, Tesla reported $280 million in capital spending. The company also paid off a convertible bond in the quarter, using up $920 million of cash. At the end of March, Tesla had $2.2 billion in cash on hand, down from $3.7 billion at end of 2018. Jeffrey Osborne, an analyst at Cowen & Company, said he expected Tesla’s operations to churn out $835 million in cash this year, but he also predicted that plant and equipment needs would use up $2.4 billion of cash. Tesla is expecting Model 3 sales to pick up as it irons out logistical problems that it says have hampered deliveries in Europe and Asia. It is not clear whether demand for the Model 3 is softening in the United States. Sales were particularly strong last year, but some of them may have been motivated by the reduction of an electric-car tax credit on Jan. 1. The credit will be reduced again on July 1 and will disappear after this year. And sales of Tesla’s older, more expensive models have recently plummeted, and these generally have fatter profit margins. But sales are not the only thing that affects Tesla’s cash. The company has plans for new models that include a large truck, the Semi, and a sport utility vehicle, the Model Y. Tesla is also developing facilities in China. And it is thinking about selling its own insurance, which could also require significant amounts of capital. Analysts think the plan announced Thursday will probably be adequate to finance the production of Tesla’s current models, but they say the company may be back for more cash as it moves to release new vehicles. Because of production problems, Tesla products have in the past come out long after the company initially said they would. If such delays recur, Tesla’s cash will be depleted and its more efficient rivals will have more time to eat into its market share with their products. For most of its existence, Tesla has failed to show consistent profits. During the past 10 years, it has posted a profit in only four quarters. “Tesla is not sustainably profitable or cash-flow positive,” said Ms. Bryan, the analyst, “so this seems like putting a finger in the dike.”",tesla seeks raise billion sale stock debt,tesla needs money lot surprisingly weak first quarter burned nearly billion company said thursday would seek raise billion markets maker plans offer investors million shares stock would raise million billion debt securities convert stock later date according regulatory filing plan could raise much billion demand great enough banks underwriting sell additional stock bonds wall street analysts noting tesla haphazard progress long expected company return public markets fresh capital kind inevitable said vicki bryan chief executive research firm bond angle first time two years tesla turned equity markets capital biggest issue new shares since raised billion company initial public offering tesla sold shares convertible securities every year raising roughly billion according data dealogic selling new shares often depresses company stock price tesla stock ended day percent sign investors still believe company achieve ambitious goals willing finance dreams pretty important tesla said ross gerber chief executive gerber kawasaki wealth investment management owns tesla shares excited able raise capital low tesla shares trade high valuation result company effectively paying little issues new shares tesla said chief executive elon musk would spend million buying new shares musk said months tesla need raise new capital discussing company results last week said merit idea raising capital probably would made financial sense tesla stock price lot higher stock third peak tesla must sell shares raise amount money new stock sold existing shareholders end smaller stake company take part new offering plan raise money also underscored tesla reliance good graces investors musk indicated last year wanted take tesla private discussions investors set series events led musk saying twitter secured funding securities exchange commission said declaration misleading musk later reached settlement regulator forced step company chairman tesla raises billion use money buffer case operations continue stumble consume large amounts cash year recent months tesla sold enough cars cover operating expenses sales main product model sedan tumbled first quarter result company operations used million cash period addition tesla reported million capital spending company also paid convertible bond quarter using million cash end march tesla billion cash hand billion end jeffrey osborne analyst cowen company said expected tesla operations churn million cash year also predicted plant equipment needs would use billion cash tesla expecting model sales pick irons logistical problems says hampered deliveries europe asia clear whether demand model softening united states sales particularly strong last year may motivated reduction tax credit credit reduced july disappear year sales tesla older expensive models recently plummeted generally fatter profit margins sales thing affects tesla cash company plans new models include large truck semi sport utility vehicle model tesla also developing facilities china thinking selling insurance could also require significant amounts capital analysts think plan announced thursday probably adequate finance production tesla current models say company may back cash moves release new vehicles production problems tesla products past come long company initially said would delays recur tesla cash depleted efficient rivals time eat market share products existence tesla failed show consistent profits past years posted profit four quarters tesla sustainably profitable positive said bryan analyst seems like putting finger dike

Stark eventually goes all in with Earth's Mightiest Heroes, ending Robert Downey Jr.'s brief crack at playing Hamlet. The Stark character, a billionaire technologist, was based on Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk — and Musk has been going through his own version of the Elsinore vacillation for over a year, as Tesla has burned a mountain of cash with no money-raising in sight. The carmaker, after a rough first quarter where it lost $700 million, is now down to about $2 billion in cash. That's uncomfortable, so Tesla has finally decided to sell some more equity and issue some additional debt. In a filing Thursday, it revealed plans to raise another $2 billion. That's still pretty skinny for an automaker with a $40 billion market cap. Ford has $24 billion in cash, with an extra $35 billion available through various other liquidity financing channels. That's enough to ride out several years' worth of recessions. Tesla, meanwhile, has enough scratch to keep the lights on for about a year. Read more: The criticism around Tesla selling emission credits proves that analysts don't understand the company's business Musk had obviously hoped to keep Tesla on a lean cash diet, avoiding the humiliation of returning yet again, hat in hand, to Wall Street. But there's no shame, really, in being in the car business and raising money. It's a capital-gobbling industry, and for a century bankers have arranged for its ongoing funding. Finally!
Mike Blake/Reuters Tesla is actually unique in that until quite recently, when companies such as General Motors started developing lines of business that could attract outside investment (its Cruise unit is now worth about $15 billion, after infusions from SoftBank and Honda), automakers had to issue debt rather than sell equity to fund operations. Tesla's stock price, though depressed from historic highs, is still well above $200 per share and is a useful form of super currency. Musk, of course, might now wish he could invent a time machine to go back to when Tesla's shares were higher than $300 and its market cap surpassed GM's. But a raise at current levels should be popular; the markets have justifiably discounted Tesla, and shares spiked 5% on Thursday morning when the funding raise was announced. Investors might sense a good deal, and for the record, $250 is around where Tesla has sold equity before. The debt piece of the raise is larger: $1.35 billion. Tesla's most recent issuance was high-yield and oversubscribed, and as the company's financial waters have gotten choppier, the quality of these bonds has declined. Tesla's next issue will be convertible notes, due in 2024. (It has sold convertible debt in the past, but earlier this year the notes failed to meet their share-price bar, and Tesla had to pay out in cash.) The upshot is that while the rest of the auto industry is loading up on cash, Tesla's balance sheet will contain more debt. No one talks much about this, but for Tesla to ramp up a car company in 2019 means its costs are in 21st-century money, while competitors that have been around for over 100 years can enjoy having built factories in the 1920s or 1950s or 1980s. Not for sale at the Apple Store.
Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider The reason no one talks about it — and by ""no one"" I mean the delusional Tesla bulls who analyze the company as though it were a Silicon Valley startup with 20 laptops and a cold-brew tap — is that it's an inconvenient truth of Tesla's actual business. The company, for example, operates a gigantic hydraulic press that takes sheets of aluminum and smashes them into the panels that make up automobiles. You can't buy one of those at the Apple Store. The ARK Invests of the world will see this raise as the first of many to fund a transformation of Tesla's 15-year existence: Electric cars are so 2010 — the action now is with robo-taxis! I'm sort of with them here, even though I'm baffled by their daffy ""analysis"" of Tesla's opportunities. In fact, it's been challenging to figure out why Tesla hasn't capitalized on its lofty stock price to put the financing risk to bed earlier. Bears will view a raise as desperate capitulation rather than good industrial logic. But they've been serially wrong about Tesla for so long now that it feels as if nothing short of bankruptcy liquidation for the firm and jail time for Musk would make them happy. Weirdly, they probably knew that fundraising was inevitable and will devise interesting new ways to style their dismay as Tesla effortlessly rakes in a couple billion more. They might be wishing they could invent a time machine of their own. Profiting from Tesla's decline requires 25 hours a day, eight days a week. Meanwhile, anybody who just, you know, bought the stock in 2010 is up 810%. Musk might be able to vacillate longer than some of his critics can remain solvent.",tesla finally going raise capital time tsla,seen avengers endgame spoilers ahead anyone seen yet know tony stark iron man vacillates whether invent time machine undo tragedy previous installment superhero series stark eventually goes earth mightiest heroes ending robert downey brief crack playing hamlet stark character billionaire technologist based tesla spacex ceo elon musk musk going version elsinore vacillation year tesla burned mountain cash sight carmaker rough first quarter lost million billion cash uncomfortable tesla finally decided sell equity issue additional debt filing thursday revealed plans raise another billion still pretty skinny automaker billion market cap ford billion cash extra billion available various liquidity financing channels enough ride several years worth recessions tesla meanwhile enough scratch keep lights year read criticism around tesla selling emission credits proves analysts understand company business musk obviously hoped keep tesla lean cash diet avoiding humiliation returning yet hat hand wall street shame really car business raising money industry century bankers arranged ongoing funding finally mike tesla actually unique quite recently companies general motors started developing lines business could attract outside investment cruise unit worth billion infusions softbank honda automakers issue debt rather sell equity fund operations tesla stock price though depressed historic highs still well per share useful form super currency musk course might wish could invent time machine go back tesla shares higher market cap surpassed gm raise current levels popular markets justifiably discounted tesla shares spiked thursday morning funding raise announced investors might sense good deal record around tesla sold equity debt piece raise larger billion tesla recent issuance oversubscribed company financial waters gotten choppier quality bonds declined tesla next issue convertible notes due sold convertible debt past earlier year notes failed meet bar tesla pay cash upshot rest auto industry loading cash tesla balance sheet contain debt one talks much tesla ramp car company means costs money competitors around years enjoy built factories sale apple store benjamin insider reason one talks one mean delusional tesla bulls analyze company though silicon valley startup laptops tap inconvenient truth tesla actual business company example operates gigantic hydraulic press takes sheets aluminum smashes panels make automobiles ca buy one apple store ark invests world see raise first many fund transformation tesla existence electric cars action sort even though baffled daffy analysis tesla opportunities fact challenging figure tesla capitalized lofty stock price put financing risk bed earlier bears view raise desperate capitulation rather good industrial logic serially wrong tesla long feels nothing short bankruptcy liquidation firm jail time musk would make happy weirdly probably knew fundraising inevitable devise interesting new ways style dismay tesla effortlessly rakes couple billion might wishing could invent time machine profiting tesla decline requires hours day eight days week meanwhile anybody know bought stock musk might able vacillate longer critics remain solvent

The publication ranked Tesla's system above those of 27 competitors. Eighty-six percent of surveyed owners reported being ""very satisfied"" with Tesla's infotainment system, 6% higher than the runner-up, BMW. Tesla's system received the highest rating for audio, calls, and navigation. In addition to BMW, other automakers ranked in the top-five included Genesis, Ford/Lincoln, and Fiat Chrysler. Lexus's system received the worst score, with just 46% of respondents saying they were very satisfied with it. Honda, Acura, Mazda, and Alfa Romeo also ranked in the bottom-five.

""A good system is one that's easy to learn and easy to use every day,"" Kelly Funkhouser, the program manager for vehicle usability and automation at Consumer Reports, said in an article accompanying the list. ""It should be responsive, not sluggish, and have straightforward controls that are easy to identify and operate."" The infotainment in the Tesla Model S.
Tesla While vehicles have traditionally featured buttons and knobs to control interior settings, Tesla vehicles have used touchscreens to handle an increasing percentage of in-car functions. In the Model 3 sedan, nearly every setting is controlled through a 15-inch touchscreen. Tesla's vehicles have received a wide range of feedback from Consumer Reports. The company placed 19th among 33 brands in the publication's 2019 overall ranking of auto brands, and has topped the publication's ranking of the most satisfying auto brands for three consecutive years. But Tesla was rated 27th of 28 brands in the publication's 2019 ranking of the most reliable auto brands, and Consumer Reports placed Tesla's Model X among its 10 least reliable vehicles. Consumer Reports retracted its recommendation of the Model 3 in February due to quality issues, but the vehicle topped the publication's 2019 owner satisfaction ranking for cars.

So Dalio — who is known for working by a set of principles and systems for success — analytically dissected what was missing without him running the company. The missing piece, Dalio and his team found, was that he was a ""shaper."" ""A shaper is someone who comes up with unique and valuable visions and builds them out beautifully, typically over the doubts and opposition of others,"" Dalio writes his book ""Principles: Life and Work. "" Apple's Steve Jobs was the most iconic shaper, he says. Bridgewater has long used personality tests for recruitment and management purposes, according to the book. So to figure out how to build up the team's ""shaping"" skills, Dalio had the best shapers he knew complete an hour-long personality assessment. Shapers including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey took the test, according to ""Principles."" (Though ""Principles"" does not say what assessment was given, Dalio has tweeted that he finds the ""Workplace Personality Inventory and Team Dimensions Profile in conjunction with the Golden Personality Profiler and Myers Briggs to be exceptionally accurate. "") Shapers, Dalio learned from the tests, ""have a lot in common."" Here are the characteristics of elite shapers, like Musk and Gates, according to ""Principles."" ""They are all independent thinkers who do not let anything or anyone stand in the way of achieving their audacious goals,"" Dalio writes. ""At times, [shapers'] extreme determination to achieve their goals can make them appear abrasive or inconsiderate, which was reflected in their test results,"" Dalio writes. ""Nothing is ever good enough, and they experience the gap between what is and what could be as both a tragedy and a source of unending motivation."" This characteristic revealed itself in the ""concern for others"" assessment category, and as Business Insider pointed out, the famous CEOs Dalio assessed ""all ranked quite low,"" according to the book. That doesn't necessarily mean they are uncaring — Bill Gates has donated more than $45 billion to charitable causes, for example. Instead, writes Dalio, ""in speaking with them and reviewing the questions that led to these ratings, it became clear: When faced with a choice between achieving their goal or pleasing (or not disappointing) others, they would choose achieving their goal every time.""  ""They have very strong mental maps of how things should be done, and at the same time a willingness to test those mental maps in the world of reality and change the ways they do things to make them work better,"" Dalio writes. That means they are ""simultaneously creative, systematic and practical. They are assertive, open-minded at the same time,"" Dalio writes. ""They are extremely resilient, because their need to achieve what they envision is stronger than the pain they experience as they struggle to achieve it,"" Dalio writes. ""Perhaps most interesting, they have a wider range of vision than most people, either because they have that vision themselves or because they know how to get it from others who can see what they can't,"" Dalio writes. ""All are able to see both big pictures and granular details (and levels in between) and synthesize the perspectives they gain at those different levels, whereas most people just see one or the other,"" Dalio writes. (Musk, for example, was as enthusiastic to show Dalio the key fob that opens a Tesla as he was to talk about the strategic vision for the car, according to the book.)  ""Above all, they are passionate about what they are doing, intolerant of people who work with them who aren't excellent at what they do, and want to have a big, beneficial impact on the world,"" Dalio writes.

Walter Huang was in the driver's seat of the Model X SUV, wearing his seatbelt at the time of the March 23, 2018, crash in Silicon Valley, According to the National Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB investigated the crash and determined that the Autopilot feature, which provides some self-driving functions to Tesla cars, was engaged for nearly 19 minutes before the fatal crash. The car veered off a highway to the left, accelerated and crashed into a concrete highway median going 71 mph, and then struck two other vehicles. After the crash, the car became engulfed in flames. Huang's family members said Tesla's Autopilot was unsafe. ""Mrs. Huang lost her husband, and two children lost their father because Tesla is beta testing its Autopilot software on live drivers,"" said B. Mark Fong, the lawyer who brought the suit filed in California state court last week. ""The Huang family wants to help prevent this tragedy from happening to other drivers using Tesla vehicles or any semi-autonomous vehicles."" ""We want to ensure the technology behind semi-autonomous cars is safe before it is released on the roads, and its risks are not withheld or misrepresented to the public,"" said Doris Cheng, another attorney working on the case. In a blog post shortly after the accident, Tesla said it determined Huang's hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the crash. Tesla analyzed data sent by the car in the moments before the crash. The company said Huang had received warnings earlier in the drive to have his hands on the wheel. It also said he had five seconds before the crash and more than 150 yards between his car and the concrete divider and did not take action to avoid it. ""Tesla Autopilot does not prevent all accidents — such a standard would be impossible — but it makes them much less likely to occur,"" said Tesla in the blog post. ""It unequivocally makes the world safer for the vehicle occupants, pedestrians and cyclists."" A separate vehicle safety report from Tesla shows that in the first quarter of this year there was one accident for every 2.87 million miles driven in which drivers had Autopilot engaged. For those driving a Tesla without Autopilot, there was one accident for every 1.76 million miles driven. The large number of Teslas in that part of California mean that there had been more than 200 successful Autopilot trips per day on this exact stretch of road, according to data released by Tesla. The suit charges that Huang believed his car in Autopilot was safer than human-driven cars. But the suit charges his car ""lacked a properly designed system for crash avoidance. As a result, it was a vehicle that could and would strike and collide with ordinary and foreseeable roadway features in Autopilot mode."" A Tesla (TSLA) spokesperson declined to comment on the suit itself.

According to two invitees who attended the call, CEO Elon Musk talked up Tesla's self-driving strategy right off the bat, expanding what he and other execs said at a recent event for investors that the company dubbed ""Autonomy Day. "" Musk confidently told investors on the call that autonomous driving will transform Tesla into a company with a $500 billion market cap, these people said. Its current market cap stands around $42 billion. He also said that existing Teslas will increase in value as self-driving capabilities are added via software, and will be worth up to $250,000 within three years. The call came as the company is looking to raise $650 million in equity and $1.35 billion in convertible bonds. Filings indicate that Tesla plans to use the capital for general corporate purposes. On the call, Musk said Tesla would be able to fund its business needs through cash flow, but that it was wise to have a buffer in case of a recession or weak global auto demand. Kirkhorn reminded investors on the call that nothing has changed in Tesla's outlook for Q2. The company still expects to deliver 90,000 to 100,000 vehicles in the second quarter, and 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles total this year. On an unadjusted basis, Tesla lost $702.1 million, or $4.10 a share, during the first quarter of 2019. The company's shares rose more than 4% on Thursday following the announcement of the new funding solicitation, but remain down more than 25% year to date. According to the two investors who heard the call, Musk described Tesla's existing electric vehicle, solar, and energy storage business lines as a backstop of value to Tesla's business in a new driverless era. He said that even though Tesla drivers need to keep hands on the wheel today, that will become less necessary over time. Musk said that competitors such as GM's Cruise and Alphabet's Waymo can't catch up because Tesla has a fleet of connected cars on the road today, and a proprietary chip. The hundreds of thousands of Teslas already on the road constantly slurp up data and send it back to Tesla's servers, which helps the company improve and advance its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems. Meanwhile, the company's self-driving computers, which it started working on about three years ago, are exclusive to Tesla and allegedly use less power in the vehicle than offerings from competitors like Nvidia. Musk reiterated that because Teslas can be upgraded ""over-the-air"" with new software-enabled features and functionality, they will appreciate in value, unlike nearly every other car on the market. A Tesla will be worth $150,000 to $250,000 in 3 years, he claimed. He also said that a full self-driving upgrade will increase the value of any Tesla by a half order of magnitude, or five times. Tesla expects to have 1 million vehicles on the road next year that are able to function as ""robo-taxis,"" Musk said, reiterating statements made at Autonomy Day and on the company's Q1 earnings call. Each car should be able to do 100 hours of work a week for its owner, making money as a robo-taxi he told investors. Some investors and analysts have expressed skepticism about the robo-taxi plan and Tesla's self-driving strategy in general. For instance, in a note to investors after Autonomy Day, Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne wrote: ""We see a significant amount of technology and execution risk in the shift in strategy from competing in just electrification to Tesla also beating Nvidia in hardware, Google in software, and building a better ride-hailing service than current ride hailing leaders. "" He added in the note, ""The Tesla Network robotaxi plans seemed half baked, with the company appearing to either not have answers to or not even considered pretty basic question on the pricing, insurance liability, or regulatory and legal requirements."" On Thursday's investor call, according to the people who heard it, Musk and other Tesla execs declined to give details when it came to more pragmatic issues like where the company's order book stands today, what they are doing to ameliorate problems with Tesla service and repairs, how much income Tesla expects to generate from regulatory credits for the rest of this year, and who will supply battery cells to Tesla in Asia as it begins manufacturing Model 3s in Shanghai. One person asked what Tesla could do to improve its gross margins from the approximately 20% reported in the first quarter of 2019. The company previously promised it could achieve 25% margins. Musk told investors Tesla would try to improve efficiency in its supply chain, but would feel good about 20% gross margins moving forward. But he also tried to drive the conversation back to autonomy, calling it the fundamental driver of value for Tesla, and urged investors to stop nit-picking over vehicle margins.

(AP) — A week after revealing a huge first quarter loss and the need to raise cash, Tesla is doing just that with CEO Elon Musk buying $10 million in new shares being offered as part of a stock and debt offering that could raise more than $2 billion. Tesla said Thursday that it’s selling $650 million of common stock and $1.35 billion in convertible senior notes due in 2024 in two separate offerings. The company is giving the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 15% of each offering. That would add up to about $2.3 billion before discounts and expenses and if the underwriters fully exercise their options. Last week, Tesla reported its cash balance at the end of the first quarter shrunk by $1.5 billion since December, to $2.2 billion. Musk said during a conference call that Tesla might need to raise capital again. The offering will give it enough liquidity to pay $566 million in notes that mature in November, plus provide cash to expand distribution of Tesla’s Model 3 in Europe and cover any spending needed from softening demand for all three of Tesla’s models in the U.S., Moody’s Senior Vice President Bruce Clark said Thursday in a statement. Still, Moody’s kept a negative outlook and B3 rating on Tesla debt. That is six notches below investment grade. Teslas for the robotaxi fleet: With every update, owners feel like they got a new car New Tesla driver experience: From an unattainable dream to $30,000 moneymaker? In a March 30 note, the ratings agency wrote that the Model 3, Tesla’s lowest-price model, currently sells for an average of $55,000. To increase sales, the price has to drop toward $42,000, and to make enough money to pay the bills, Tesla has targeted a 25% gross profit margin on the Model 3, Moody’s said. Currently gross profits on a $42,000 Model 3 are “materially” below 25%, according to Moody’s. “In order to achieve this margin target the company will have to undertake significant reductions in fixed and variable costs associated with the vehicle,” Moody’s wrote. “We expect that it will be a major challenge for Tesla to aggressively increase production/deliveries, shift the product mix toward the $42,000 price level, and simultaneously lower costs enough to achieve the 25% gross margin target.” The Palo Alto, California-based Tesla lost $702.1 million in the first quarter, among its worst quarters in two years. Sales tumbled 31% in the period. Musk predicted another loss in the second quarter but said Tesla would be profitable again by the third quarter. The surprisingly large loss followed the company’s first back to back quarters of profitability. Tesla has lost more than $6 billion since setting out to revolutionize the auto industry. Musk expects that future profits will be driven by rising sales and the arrival of autonomous vehicles dedicated to a new ride-hailing service.

Here's what it looked like,"Elon Musk has called Tesla's Gigafactory the ""machine that builds the machine."" The $4.5 billion factory, located outside Reno, Nevada, is where Tesla and Panasonic, its principal partner, produce battery packs for Tesla's Model 3 sedan, along with energy storage products and more. CNBC went inside the Gigafactory to view the production process and understand how the company's first fully built factory will serve as the model for what eventually could be a dozen massive Tesla factories globally. ""In order to transition the world to sustainable energy, we really needed to build this big, build this boldly and really build as many battery cells as we possibly could to really accelerate this transition,"" Chris Lister, Tesla's vice president for operations, told CNBC. Only about 30% of the factory is currently built out, but upon completion it could be the world's largest building by footprint. The partnership between Tesla and Panasonic has come under strain recently. Last month, Tesla, denied reports that it was placing Gigafactory expansion plans on hold. Meanwhile, Musk claimed Panasonic was unable to meet production goals for battery cell output. Tesla, meanwhile, said U.S. orders for Model 3 had outpaced its available output in the first quarter. The Gigafactory, which is open around the clock, currently has 7,000 employees. Yet humans were few and far between during CNBC's portion of the tour as automation was highly apparent, with one section of the facility boasting a 90% automated process, according to Lister. Still, he said the company has had to back off on automation in some cases, in favor of human labor. ""It's easier to, you know, grab things like hoses out of midair and attach them together as a person looking at those, as opposed to trying to get a robot to do that,"" he said. Meanwhile, Tesla's $2 billion dollar Gigafactory in Shanghai, or Gigafactory 3, which broke ground this year, is expected to produce Tesla's Model 3 using a complete vehicle production line before the end of the year. Lister said Tesla is using what it's learned from its Nevada facility toward its upcoming China factory and hoping to use the original Gigafactory as an operational model for all future facilities. ""So many people have invested so much of their lives into making this successful,"" Lister said. ""It really is a competitive advantage, but it is also so important in accelerating the advent of sustainable transport.""",went inside tesla gigafactory looked like,elon musk called tesla gigafactory machine builds machine billion factory located outside reno nevada tesla panasonic principal partner produce battery packs tesla model sedan along energy storage products cnbc went inside gigafactory view production process understand company first fully built factory serve model eventually could dozen massive tesla factories globally order transition world sustainable energy really needed build big build boldly really build many battery cells possibly could really accelerate transition chris lister tesla vice president operations told cnbc factory currently built upon completion could world largest building footprint partnership tesla panasonic come strain recently last month tesla denied reports placing gigafactory expansion plans hold meanwhile musk claimed panasonic unable meet production goals battery cell output tesla meanwhile said orders model outpaced available output first quarter gigafactory open around clock currently employees yet humans far cnbc portion tour automation highly apparent one section facility boasting automated process according lister still said company back automation cases favor human labor easier know grab things like hoses midair attach together person looking opposed trying get robot said meanwhile tesla billion dollar gigafactory shanghai gigafactory broke ground year expected produce tesla model using complete vehicle production line end year lister said tesla using learned nevada facility toward upcoming china factory hoping use original gigafactory operational model future facilities many people invested much lives making successful lister said really competitive advantage also important accelerating advent sustainable transport

The lending was disclosed in Tesla's prospectus on Thursday to raise up to $2.3 billion with new shares and convertible debt, and it was $117 million less than the personal loans to Musk disclosed in Tesla's previous prospectus in 2017. Still, Tesla said that if the price of its stock falls and the banks force Musk to sell some of his shares, that could create additional pressure on the stock. Tesla jumped over 4% after the company disclosed capital raising plans, which soothed investors' recent concerns about the Palo Alto, California company and pulled its stock up from two-year lows. Musk, who owns 20% of Tesla, has taken personal loans from Wall Street banks for years. A Tesla 2017 prospectus showed $624 million in loans to Musk. The filing on Thursday showed Musk owed money to three banks working on the capital increase. Goldman Sachs has $213 million in loans outstanding to Musk, while he owes Morgan Stanley $209 million, and another $85 million to Bank of America Corp. Goldman was not mentioned as a personal lender to Musk in the 2017 filing. Brendan McDermid/Reuters Read more: Millennials are pouring into Tesla's stock following the electric-car maker's disastrous quarter Those loans are backed by Musk's shares in Tesla, currently worth a total of around $8 billion. If Tesla's stock declines, then Musk could be forced to sell some of those shares under terms of the loan, according to the Tesla filing. Mark Williams, a professor of finance at Boston University, said that investment banks can run into conflicts of interest with their deals with companies, their founders and CEOs, testing their rules to keep different businesses separate. ""This is particularly true in the case of Tesla where you have an aggressive and vocal CEO who is prone to pushing the legal limits and gain terms that might run counter to Goldman's conflict of interest policies,"" Williams said. Goldman and Citigroup Inc, the top-line book runners in Thursday's capital raise, both have ""sell"" ratings on Tesla's stock, which is unusual but not exceptional on Wall Street. At the end of 2018, Musk and his trust had 13.4 million Tesla shares pledged as collateral for personal debts, according to another filing. That is down from 13.8 million shares at the end of 2017. Tesla, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs declined to talk about the loans. Tesla has a policy that caps executives' borrowings at a quarter of the value of the shares pledged as collateral. With Tesla repeatedly pushing back forecasts for turning a profit, its stock has dropped 27% year to date. Musk plans to buy another $10 million worth of shares as part of the sale announced on Thursday.

As described in a blog post, Lane Departure Avoidance and Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance use the cameras, sensors and radar in its cars to avoid dangerous situations. Other manufacturers use their car's driving assist sensors in similar ways, and it's good to see Tesla enhancing safety at all times. The features are coming to Model 3 cars first, and eventually all of its cars built after October 2016, which are the ones equipped with NVIDIA-powered Autopilot 2.0 hardware or newer. When the new hardware first rolled out, it lacked some of the earlier setup's safety features including basic lane departure warnings, but eventually added them with calibration and updates. Even with the updates, the Autopilot system has also faced controversy due to accidents and claims drivers aren't paying enough attention while the system is enabled -- today's post notably specifies that ""Autopilot is designed to reduce fatigue by helping drivers stay in their lane, while also ensuring that they keep their hands on the wheel.""  Now, it adds Lane Departure Avoidance, which expands the warning system with corrective steering that guides their car back if the system detects it's leaving without the turn signal activated. As this is for use without Autopilot enabled, if the driver doesn't have their hands on the wheel then it will send various alerts instead, and if cruise control is on, it will slow down and turn the hazard lights on. Drivers can opt to have the feature on or off at any time, and it works when the car is going between 20 MPH and 90 MPH. Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance is slightly different, in that it's automatically enabled whenever you start driving, although it can be disabled for the current trip. If it detects that the car is veering out of its lane and could hit something, or go entirely off the road, this is the part of the technology that will automatically direct it back into the lane to avoid an accident.",tesla adds lane departure avoidance works autopilot,tesla continues tout benefits autopilot driving assist insist true capability close release latest updates work even autopilot described blog post lane departure avoidance emergency lane departure avoidance use cameras sensors radar cars avoid dangerous situations manufacturers use car driving assist sensors similar ways good see tesla enhancing safety times features coming model cars first eventually cars built october ones equipped autopilot hardware newer new hardware first rolled lacked earlier setup safety features including basic lane departure warnings eventually added calibration updates even updates autopilot system also faced controversy due accidents claims drivers paying enough attention system enabled today post notably specifies autopilot designed reduce fatigue helping drivers stay lane also ensuring keep hands wheel adds lane departure avoidance expands warning system corrective steering guides car back system detects leaving without turn signal activated use without autopilot enabled driver hands wheel send various alerts instead cruise control slow turn hazard lights drivers opt feature time works car going mph mph emergency lane departure avoidance slightly different automatically enabled whenever start driving although disabled current trip detects car veering lane could hit something go entirely road part technology automatically direct back lane avoid accident

Instead of merely warning you — like the Lane Departure Warning feature — the new features, called Lane Departure Avoidance and Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance, take active measures to make sure you stay in your lane. Lane Departure Avoidance, when enabled, will apply corrective steering to make sure the car stays in the intended lane. If the driver starts departing a lane without switching the turn signal on, and if the driver's hands are not on the wheel, the feature will also start alerting the driver that the car is departing the lane. Finally, if Traffic Aware Cruise Control is in use, and the driver's hands are ""repeatedly"" not detected on the wheel, the car will slow down to 15 miles below the speed limit, and turn the hazard lights on. Lane Departure Avoidance works at speeds between 25 and 90 mph and can be turned on or off at will. The other new feature is Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance, which will steer the car back into the driving lane if the system detects the car is departing its lane and that there could be a collision, or the car is close to the edge of the road. Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance is on by default at the beginning of every drive, but it can be turned off for a single drive in the Autopilot Controls menu. The cool thing about these new features is that, while they're based on the same tech as Autopilot, they work without Autopilot (which, until recently, was an optional purchase). The new features will be gradually added to all Tesla cars built after October 2016, starting with Model 3 and expanding to other models.

The company is selling 3.1 million shares at a price of $243 per share through underwriters Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, according to filing. That's up from the 2.7 million shares previously expected to be sold at the offering. The company also said it was boosting its convertible notes offering to $1.6 billion, according to filings. Musk now intends to purchase up to 102,880 shares in stock worth $25 million, more than double his previous indication to buy 41,896 shares. The updated figures bring the total value of the offering to about $2.7 billion, up from the $2.3 billion expected following the Thursday announcement. ""As for the upsize of the deal - it's usually driven by greater demand.

In a new set of regulatory filings Friday morning, the company increased the amount of cash it expects to raise by about 17.5%. Part of the increase is because of a slightly higher estimated price of the shares being sold. Shares gained 4% in trading Thursday after the initial capital raise was announced. But Tesla also plans to sell more shares of stock to the public, along with more debt that can be paid off with stock in the future if the share price can hit a certain target. Tesla's (TSLA) stock was slightly higher in premarket trading. Although the additional shares will dilute the value of current Tesla shares, investors had been prepared for the capital raise since last week. Some may have been preparing for an even larger sale of shares. Some investors worried that the company could find itself in a cash crunch without a cash raise. ""We view this as a clear net positive for Tesla,"" said Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, in a note to clients Thursday. ""The company needed to take its medicine and clear the air of the very real investor worries that the company would not having enough capital to meet its debt obligation this November and future [capital spending] needs."" CEO Elon Musk had insisted through much of the last year that the company was doing fine and would not need to raise additional cash. But a depressed stock price forced it to pay off a $920 million bond in March with cash rather than stock. That payment was a big factor in the company's cash reserves falling by $1.5 billion during the quarter, leaving it with just over $2 billion in cash on its balance sheet. It also reported a $702 million loss in the quarter. After reporting results last week, Musk told investors that ""at this point, I do think there ... is some merit to raising capital."" The timing and the extent of that raise was not disclosed at that time. Tesla intends to use proceeds from the offerings to strengthen its balance sheet, as well as for general corporate purposes. Musk himself intends to buy $25 million of the shares once they are offered. That's up from his original plan to purchase $10 million worth of shares. -- Correction: An earlier version incorrectly stated the number of shares that Musk intends to buy.

Musk indicated a willingness to raise new capital, however, following a $700 million loss in its first fiscal quarter of this year that left the company with $2.2 billion in cash.

The company, a major minerals consumer, has rarely talked publicly about its views on the metals industry. Copper, nickel, lithium and related minerals are key components used to make electric-vehicle batteries and other parts. Scroll down for video Tesla Inc expects global shortages of nickel, copper and other electric-vehicle battery minerals down the road due to underinvestment in the mining sector, the company's global supply manager for battery metals told an industry conference on Thursday Sarah Maryssael, Tesla's global supply manager for battery metals, told a closed-door Washington conference of miners, regulators and lawmakers that the automaker sees a shortage of key EV minerals coming, according to the sources. According to a Tesla spokesman, the comments were industry-specific and referring to the long-term supply challenges that may occur with regards to these metals. The copper industry has suffered from years of underinvestment, and it is now working feverishly to develop new mines and bring fresh supply online as the electrification trend envelops the global economy. Freeport-McMoRan Inc, the world's largest publicly traded copper producer, is expanding in the United States and Indonesia. Electric cars use twice as much copper as internal combustion engines. So-called smart-home systems - such as Alphabet Inc's Nest thermostat and Amazon.com Inc's Alexa personal assistant - will consume about 1.5 million tonnes of copper by 2030, up from 38,000 tonnes today, according to data from consultancy BSRIA. All that will make the red metal - and other minerals - scarcer commodities, which worries Tesla. Maryssael added, according to the sources, that Tesla will continue to focus more on nickel, part of a plan by Chief Executive Elon Musk to use less cobalt in battery cathodes. Cobalt is primarily mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and some extraction techniques - especially those using child labor - have made its use deeply unpopular across the battery industry, especially with Musk. Maryssael told the conference, hosted by commodity pricing tracker Benchmark Minerals Intelligence, that there is 'huge potential' to partner with mines in Australia or the United States, according to the sources. Australia late last year signed a preliminary deal with the United States to support joint research and development of minerals deemed critical to the U.S. economy. The conference, attended by more than 100 people, featured speakers from the U.S. Department of State and Department of Energy, as well as Standard Lithium Ltd, ioneer Ltd and other companies working to develop U.S. lithium mines. Tesla has created a Supercharger network around the world that allows its electric vehicles to power up for long distance travel. Prices of using the service vary across the world, and they can be found here. To charge a Tesla, drivers park and plug in their vehicle using the connector at the Supercharger post. Tesla has created a Supercharger network around the world that allows its electric vehicles to power up for long distance travel Once plugged in, the vehicle's charge port will flash green to indicate that charging has started.

China's State Administration of Press and Publication (SAPP) unveiled its guidelines for releasing new games in China during a press conference on April 10, according to Niko Partners. The Chinese government established the SAPP in April 2018 to oversee the approval of new media in the country. But as SAPP established its process for approvals, China halted the release of new video games in the country for nearly eight months. The SAPP eventually established the Online Games Ethics Committee to review new games and make sure they meet the government's standards. According to Niko Partners, the ethics committee prohibits anything that violates or threatens China's constitution, national security, or political climate; games that promote racism or religious cults; and obscene content featuring drug use, extreme violence, or gambling. Extreme violence would include images of dead bodies and pools of blood, though the country does accept some games with guns and other weapons. Read more:Kids in China are trying every trick in the book to beat the facial recognition software that puts a mandatory time limit on popular video games With the new oversight committee in place, China has approved about 1,000 new video games for release since December 2018. But those games come from a backlog of titles that were originally submitted for approval between April and July 2018. The committee still has months-worth of old games to review and hundreds of new applicants will likely be submitting games through the updated application process. Chinese officials have expressed concerns about video games leading to addiction and an overall lack of productivity. Video game versions of poker and mahjong are wildly popular in China and made up about one-third of the country's new video games in 2017. The country's regulators are specifically looking to crack down on the number of gambling-related games moving forward. Chinese regulators have also been working to introduce mandatory time limits for gamers under the age of 18. Tencent, China's largest video game company and the world biggest publisher, began implementing mandatory age restrictions on its own last year, while the Chinese government was still blocking new releases. To manage the age restrictions, Tencent introduced a new program called the Real Name Identity System (RNIS). Players under the age of 18 were limited to playing just two hours a day, while those under the age of 12 were limited to one hour a day. Each player's name and age is checked against the national citizen database maintained by China's Ministry of Public Security. Tencent also introduced facial recognition software in September 2018, starting with thousands of randomly selected gamers living in Beijing and Shenzhen. Despite the country's strict regulations on video games, China's gamers generated an estimated $34.4 billion in revenue during 2018, according to NewZoo. With clear regulations in place, publishers will have a better idea of how to get their games into one of the world's most valuable markets for video games.",china released guidelines approving new video games one year putting freeze new releases country,china officially introduced new regulations publishing video games clarifying world largest video game market accepts new releases china state administration press publication sapp unveiled guidelines releasing new games china press conference april according niko partners chinese government established sapp april oversee approval new media country sapp established process approvals china halted release new video games country nearly eight months sapp eventually established online games ethics committee review new games make sure meet government standards according niko partners ethics committee prohibits anything violates threatens china constitution national security political climate games promote racism religious cults obscene content featuring drug use extreme violence gambling extreme violence would include images dead bodies pools blood though country accept games guns weapons read kids china trying every trick book beat facial recognition software puts mandatory time limit popular video games new oversight committee place china approved new video games release since december games come backlog titles originally submitted approval april july committee still old games review hundreds new applicants likely submitting games updated application process chinese officials expressed concerns video games leading addiction overall lack productivity video game versions poker mahjong wildly popular china made country new video games country regulators specifically looking crack number games moving forward chinese regulators also working introduce mandatory time limits gamers age tencent china largest video game company world biggest publisher began implementing mandatory age restrictions last year chinese government still blocking new releases manage age restrictions tencent introduced new program called real name identity system rnis players age limited playing two hours day age limited one hour day player name age checked national citizen database maintained china ministry public security tencent also introduced facial recognition software september starting thousands randomly selected gamers living beijing shenzhen despite country strict regulations video games china gamers generated estimated billion revenue according newzoo clear regulations place publishers better idea get games one world valuable markets video games

The Palo Alto, Calif., electric car and solar panel maker said it's increasing the offer due to the positive response from Thursday's announcement that it would try to raise $2.3 billion. Also, CEO Elon Musk more than doubled the amount of stock he would buy from $10 million, to $25 million. The offer, detailed in a filing Friday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, includes up to $1.84 billion in notes that pay two per cent annual interest and convert to Tesla common stock in 2024. Also included are more than 3.5 million new shares worth as much as $866 million. The new numbers include underwriting brokers exercising their full options to buy additional notes and shares. Cash balance low Last week, Tesla reported its cash balance at the end of the first quarter shrank by $1.5 billion since December, to $2.2 billion. Musk said during a conference call that Tesla might need to raise capital again. The company will use the proceeds to ""further strengthen our balance sheet, as well as for general corporate purposes,"" the filing says. But the offerings would raise the company's debt from $9.79 billion to as high as $11.63 billion, with the company admitting in its filing that it may not be able to generate enough cash to make all of the payments. ""If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive,"" the company wrote in the part of the filing that discusses risk factors. Bet on Tesla stock price Musk likely raised his own stake to show shareholders that he's putting more of his own money into the company and taking the same risk that he's asking investors to, said Gartner analyst Michael Ramsey. But he's also guarding against dilution of his ownership stake, Ramsey said. Musk is by far the company's largest shareholder with about a 20 per cent stake. Tesla's shares would have to reach $309.83 by May 15, 2024 for the notes to be converted to stock. That's a 21 per cent increase over the current price. If they don't hit that price, Tesla is on the hook to repay the notes largely in cash, according to the filings. In a statement on the offering Thursday, Moody's senior vice-president Bruce Clark wrote that the offering will give Tesla enough liquidity to pay $566 million in notes that mature in November, plus provide cash to expand distribution of Tesla's Model 3 in Europe and cover spending needed from softening demand for all three of Tesla's models in the U.S. Moody's kept a negative outlook and B3 rating on Tesla debt. That is six notches below investment grade. In a March 30 note, the ratings agency wrote that the Model 3, Tesla's lowest-price model, currently sells for an average of $55,000. To increase sales, the price has to drop toward $42,000, and to make enough money to pay the bills, Tesla has targeted a 25 per cent gross profit margin on the Model 3, Moody's said. Currently gross profits on a $42,000 Model 3 are ""materially"" below that level, according to Moody's. Moody's has doubts ""In order to achieve this margin target the company will have to undertake significant reductions in fixed and variable costs associated with the vehicle,"" Moody's wrote. ""We expect that it will be a major challenge for Tesla to aggressively increase production/deliveries, shift the product mix toward the $42,000 price level, and simultaneously lower costs enough to achieve the 25 per cent gross margin target."" Tesla, Moody's wrote, has no sustainable technical advantage over competitors. ""Essentially all of the technologies incorporated in Tesla vehicles [or some similarly effective alternative technologies] will largely be available to competitors,"" according to Moody's. The company lost $702.1 million in the first quarter, among its worst quarters in two years. Sales tumbled 31 per cent in the period. Musk predicted another loss in the second quarter but said Tesla would be profitable again by the third quarter. The surprisingly large loss followed the company's first back to back quarters of profitability. Tesla has lost more than $6 billion since setting out to revolutionize the auto industry. Musk expects that future profits will be driven by rising sales and the arrival of autonomous vehicles dedicated to a new ride-hailing service.

Osborne said he believed Tesla's upcoming capital raise was ""badly needed"" but too small to cover future costs. ""We update our model to reflect the up to $2.7bn capital raise, which was badly needed but do not see this as sufficient to fund capex, pay off debt, and offset the cash burn that is playing out with lower than planned volume and margins on the Model 3,"" Osborne said.

The company's shares rose 1.2% in premarket trading on Friday and were trading at $246.95 at the market open. Musk said last year that he didn't want to raise capital and that Tesla could become financially self-sufficient even as some analysts argued that a new round of fundraising would strengthen the company's balance sheet and ease investor concerns. Musk indicated a willingness to raise new capital, however, following a $700 million loss in its first fiscal quarter of 2019 that left the company with $2.2 billion in cash.

Former NFL kicker and defending stock draft champion Nick Lowery is betting that Nvidia, AMD, and Microsoft will deliver him a second trophy and fend off the likes of star Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard, ""Shark Tank"" investor Kevin O'Leary and Skinnygirl mogul Bethenny Frankel. On April 25th, the ten teams chose from a list of 61 investments, including stocks and other assets such as oil and bitcoin. Three rounds, one pick per team per round. The final list of selections can be found here. The contest began with the closing price on the 25th and will end with the closing price on the final trading day before the Super Bowl (January 31, 2020). The winner is the contestant with the highest average price appreciation of his or her three selections. Which team is best positioned to win? We asked the pros. Seven strategists, traders, and chief investment officers sent us their thoughts on who is most and least likely to take home the trophy. We should note that everyone we spoke to was clear that they wouldn't recommend their clients or anyone use the Stock Draft parameters as an actual investment strategy or buy these stocks based on which ones they think will perform best in this specific contest. Best Portfolio: Nick the Kick's Pix (Nick Lowery) Worst Portfolio: Mr. Wonderful (Kevin O'Leary) Nancy says: There were some awesome portfolios and it was very hard to pick a winner. But I selected Nick Lowery as the likely winner based on our thesis that global growth is accelerating and that technology spend will continue to dominate capex spending and keep growing faster than GDP. Nvidia is my least favorite of his picks, but I'm expecting the portfolio as a whole to generate outstanding returns. My choice for worst-performing portfolio is Kevin O'Leary. It's not the underlying quality of the stocks, but rather the fact that the portfolio is defensive in an environment where we expect cyclicals to outperform. Now is not the time to be defensive. We're seeing stronger-than-expected GDP, and a well-heeled consumer may not reward his consumer staple picks. Best Portfolio: Seymour Alpha (Tim Seymour) Worst Portfolio: Oz Knows (Oz Pearlman) Steve says: The way to win the Stock Draft is to find long shots that are currently out of favor, simply because those are the names with the most upside if they ever get traction – that's why Tim Seymour has a great chance at winning. GE has been so out of favor it wouldn't be hard to string together a couple of days with positive headlines and see the stock take off like a rocket. (Disclosure: I personally own GE for the same reasons). Electronic Arts' Apex Legends has the best shot at giving Fortnite a real run for its money. And Macy's has been the poster child of the death of brick and mortar. Just on their real estate holdings alone, Macy's is worth much more than its current price. In keeping with the same theme, the stocks that are not out of favor are the least likely to dominate this kind of contest. That's why I don't like Oz Pearlman's portfolio. Disney has already had an incredible run – it will be hard for the stock to move higher from here. Goldman Sachs could move higher, but seems to have lost momentum and I'm not sure financials are the best play in a lower-rate environment. Bitcoin is the wildcard and could prove me wrong here, but the way I see it – he's putting all hopes for a win on this one name. Best Portfolio: Nick the Kick's Pix (Nick Lowery) Worst Portfolio: Blue Chip Leaders (Maria Ho) Peter says: Nick Lowery takes the top spot for me. His draft picks have two backups (Microsoft, AMD) and a real starter (Nvidia). But Nvidia is so jacked it makes the other two look tiny in comparison. Nick's best scenario is that the Nvidia breakout will overshadow the two busts. I picked Maria Ho to take last here. It looks like she didn't draft any running backs and picked her defense too early. There are no draft studs on this team that can really break out. And isn't Apple on IR (injured reserve)? Best Portfolio: The Green Machine (Jarvis Green) Worst Portfolio: Thor's Hammer (Noah Syndergaard) Shannon says: I'm going with Jarvis Green's picks here. This may have been a portfolio built on the ""buy what you know"" philosophy, and I think we can count on the consumer to continue to deliver in the back half of the year. I like the Constellation Brands play, as you get cannabis along with an established business in order to offset volatility associated with federal legalization questions. With Lululemon, you've got an undersaturated footprint, high quality product and a move into men's that could be a legitimate tailwind in the next 3-4 quarters. Netflix is challenging, as the showdown with Disney is now underway – but international growth and overall desire for different sources of content should allow for appreciation. As for last – I'm going with Noah Syndergaard. Any portfolio with 33% in Tesla is going to lose, in my opinion. Corporate management and capital allocation is important, as is transparency and staying in the good graces of the SEC. Amazon and Nike are good picks, but Nike is definitely leveraged to consumer growth in China, which could prove choppy over the next several years. Best Portfolio: Seymour Alpha (Tim Seymour) Worst Portfolio: Mr. Wonderful (Kevin O'Leary) Paul says: The portfolios that have the best chance of winning are the ones that have some of the most beaten-down stocks that could really rebound. That's why I like Tim Seymour's picks. If sentiment towards any of these stocks starts to improve, they could end up carrying the portfolio. Then again, if sentiment doesn't turn – things could get ugly. To the downside, Kevin O'Leary's portfolio looks nice and safe. Unless the market does nothing or goes down over the next year, it's hard to see all of these stocks having big gains – especially since dividends don't count. Best Portfolio: Beardstown Ladies Worst Portfolio: The Green Machine (Jarvis Green) David says: The Beardstown Ladies have exposure to tech, healthcare and financials in companies we think should fare well in the upcoming year. My least favorite portfolio is Jarvis Green's. All of the names have had a great run already in 2018 and we think one or two could have subpar returns in the upcoming year. Best Portfolio: Thor's Hammer (Noah Syndergaard) Worst Portfolio: Bobby's Bulls (Bobby Flay) Jon says: Noah Syndergaard is my pick for top portfolio here. Tesla is so beaten down right now that it's positioned to give him the most outperformance. And he's got two solid performers with Amazon and Nike. Noah's got a monster offense with Tesla, if the stock really takes off. I hate to do it, but I'm picking Bobby Flay for last place. He chose good, solid stocks, but they're not going to outperform in this time frame. He didn't pick a wildcard that could rocket him to the top. He's got strong defense but virtually no offense.",noah syndergaard bethenny frankel grading cnbc stock draft players picks,cnbc stock draft well underway former nfl kicker defending stock draft champion nick lowery betting nvidia amd microsoft deliver second trophy fend likes star mets pitcher noah syndergaard shark tank investor kevin skinnygirl mogul bethenny frankel april ten teams chose list investments including stocks assets oil bitcoin three rounds one pick per team per round final list selections found contest began closing price end closing price final trading day super bowl january winner contestant highest average price appreciation three selections team best positioned win asked pros seven strategists traders chief investment officers sent us thoughts least likely take home trophy note everyone spoke clear would recommend clients anyone use stock draft parameters actual investment strategy buy stocks based ones think perform best specific contest best portfolio nick kick pix nick lowery worst portfolio mr wonderful kevin nancy says awesome portfolios hard pick winner selected nick lowery likely winner based thesis global growth accelerating technology spend continue dominate capex spending keep growing faster gdp nvidia least favorite picks expecting portfolio whole generate outstanding returns choice portfolio kevin underlying quality stocks rather fact portfolio defensive environment expect cyclicals outperform time defensive seeing gdp consumer may reward consumer staple picks best portfolio seymour alpha tim seymour worst portfolio oz knows oz pearlman steve says way win stock draft find long shots currently favor simply names upside ever get traction tim seymour great chance winning ge favor would hard string together couple days positive headlines see stock take like rocket disclosure personally ge reasons electronic arts apex legends best shot giving fortnite real run money macy poster child death brick mortar real estate holdings alone macy worth much current price keeping theme stocks favor least likely dominate kind contest like oz pearlman portfolio disney already incredible run hard stock move higher goldman sachs could move higher seems lost momentum sure financials best play environment bitcoin wildcard could prove wrong way see putting hopes win one name best portfolio nick kick pix nick lowery worst portfolio blue chip leaders maria ho peter says nick lowery takes top spot draft picks two backups microsoft amd real starter nvidia nvidia jacked makes two look tiny comparison nick best scenario nvidia breakout overshadow two busts picked maria ho take last looks like draft running backs picked defense early draft studs team really break apple ir injured reserve best portfolio green machine jarvis green worst portfolio thor hammer noah syndergaard shannon says going jarvis green picks may portfolio built buy know philosophy think count consumer continue deliver back half year like constellation brands play get cannabis along established business order offset volatility associated federal legalization questions lululemon got undersaturated footprint high quality product move men could legitimate tailwind next quarters netflix challenging showdown disney underway international growth overall desire different sources content allow appreciation last going noah syndergaard portfolio tesla going lose opinion corporate management capital allocation important transparency staying good graces sec amazon nike good picks nike definitely leveraged consumer growth china could prove choppy next several years best portfolio seymour alpha tim seymour worst portfolio mr wonderful kevin paul says portfolios best chance winning ones stocks could really rebound like tim seymour picks sentiment towards stocks starts improve could end carrying portfolio sentiment turn things could get ugly downside kevin portfolio looks nice safe unless market nothing goes next year hard see stocks big gains especially since dividends count best portfolio beardstown ladies worst portfolio green machine jarvis green david says beardstown ladies exposure tech healthcare financials companies think fare well upcoming year least favorite portfolio jarvis green names great run already think one two could subpar returns upcoming year best portfolio thor hammer noah syndergaard worst portfolio bobby bulls bobby flay jon says noah syndergaard pick top portfolio tesla beaten right positioned give outperformance got two solid performers amazon nike noah got monster offense tesla stock really takes hate picking bobby flay last place chose good solid stocks going outperform time frame pick wildcard could rocket top got strong defense virtually offense
